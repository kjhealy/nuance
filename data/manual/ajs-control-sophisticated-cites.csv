Patterns of age at marriage and mate selection among Jewish population groups of Middle Eastern (Oriental) origin are contrasted with those of the Moslem Arab population. The institutionalization of fertility control and declining fertility among the Oriental Jewish couples marrying in Israel is contrasted with sustained high fertility of Moslem Arab couples. The relationship between change in matchmaking and amrriage patterns and change in matchmaking and marriage patterns is explored, and three conditions under which young couples beome independent decision-making units and try to control fertility are hypothesized."

Rural Ladinos of midwestern Guatemala are, with respect to education, intermediate between tribal and urban society. Schools exist, but they have little importance. On the other hand, ceremony and myth do not play a large par in the transfer of tradition. The attention of the investigator is therefore drawn to the more elementary and universal aspects of education: the informal day-to-day situations in which tradition is communicated or modified. Such a situation is analyzed, and the educational importance of these occurrences remarked, in this Guatemalan society where schools represent regulation largely external to the culture and where important traditional ceremonials are lacking."

Although attention is paid to the relative validity of different approaches to empirical investigation, constant attempts are made to freeze sociological framework into a permanent mold. Terminology is standardized rather than evaluated for its own utility. Different theories compete for all-purpose acceptance. Rationalization for the commitment to fixed theoretical structures may be seen in the increasing bureaucratization of sociological research, which cannot tolerate theoretical uncertainties."

Participation in solidary groups has consequences for the social bases of politics, and the political salience of such groups is affected by social institutions that are independent of occupational structure. The first such institution is direct rule. Whereas indirect rule tends to promote class politics, direct rule favors cultural politics. Rapid expansion of direct rule since the 1960s has muted class politics and increased cultural politics. This relationship is not deterministic, however; other institutions can mitigate the effects of direct rule on the social bases of politics."

Much of this work has a psychological orientation. There are differences in emphasis between the relationalistic (strategic) and the non-rationalistic approaches. Schelling has transformed classic game theory into a theory of interaction. Rapoport rejects the game approach as leading to absurd results. Richardson's collective-behavior model is espoused by both Rapoport and Boulding, but it is used differently by them. The bureaucratization of violence has been commented on by Hannah Arendt. The theory of non-violence has not been cultivated; but Schelling's concept of the co-ordination game may prove useful. Sociological research tends to be empirical rather than theoretical, but it now applies more sophisticated techniques than in the past. Experimental studies, based on laboratory ""games"" and simulation studies, combine theoretical and empirical approaches. Some of these games are as useful as projective tests as they are as techniques for studying conflict."

Martin,American Journal of Sociology,57,6,1952-05-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 546-564,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,In certain studies of the cohesiveness of small groups the operational definition of cohesiveness are logically deficient because they do not measure the dimensions of cohesiveness as nominally defined by the investigators. These studies are empirically deficient because single measurement of cohesiveness of the same groups are not positively and highly correlated. A unitary concept of cohesiveness is unacceptable because of the incorrect assumption that different aspect of cohesiveness are highly correlated. Additional limitations are lack of concern for the importance of the negative case in scientific investigations and overgeneralization. Alternative operational and conceptual definitions are suggested.

This paper describes a design in which intergenerational mobility is studies from two perspectives. In the conventional approach sons report on their own statuses and give proxy reports for parental statuses. In our second perspective parents are questioned about themselves and give proxy information on their children. Estimates of a five-variable status-attainment model for eachperspective yield similar results, but some correlations and regressions differ significantly because nonrandom errors influence the reporting of socioeconomic data among adults. Our anomalous findings suggest that mobility researchers might consider employing both questioning strategies as a guide to potential biases until a definitive test shows that the caution prescribed in this paper is unwarranted. Consumers of mobility studies are entitled to reserve judgment on data that depend entirely on the traditional approach even though current research adheres to it almost without exception."

Such an elite is seen to profit through the increasing intensification of the land use of the area in which its members hold a common interest. An elite competes with other land-based elites in an effort to have growth-inducing resources invested within its own area as opposed to that of another. Governmental authority, at the local and nonlocal levels, is utilized to assist in achieving this growth at the expense of competing localities. Conditions of community life are largely a consequence of the social, econimic, and political forces embodied in this growth machine. The relevance of growth to the interests of various social groups is examined in this context, particularly with reference to the issue of unemployment. Recent social trends in opposition to growth are described and their potential consequences evaluated."

Almost universally, the individual German projects responsibility upon the Nazi party or the S.S.

What is needed to sustain morale is a body of industrial folkways. The modern factory is not a society. Industrial fatigue and lack of morale are due to some interference or failure to preserve the organic and social balance. What is true with regard to industry applies also to industrial civilization generally. Increasing mobility and industrial expansion have broken up the traditional order and have not permitted the establishing of a new one. The ills of modern industrial civilization are cultural, not political, and are incident to the existing industrial regime."

New-class theorists have depicted these ""knowledge workers"" as engaged in a contest for power and status with traditionally powerful business elites. However, the liberal attitudes of knowledge workers may also be interpreted as the result of a conjunction of several general trends in American society that have had little to do with class antagonisms. According to this paper, even though left-of-center attitudes are not uncommon in the salaried professional categories, these attitudes tend to be more ferormist than antibusiness in character. Such dissent as exists is concentrated in particular occupational, cohort, and sectoral categories and has varied considerably over time. Only the younger specialists in social science and arts-related occupations beging to fit the image of an ""oppositional intelligentsia"" used by the theorists to characterize the new class at large. The data are more consistent with cumulative-trend explanations of upper-white-collar liberalism and dissent. Nevertheless, the consistent net association of the key new-class category, the higher levels of education, with political liberalism leaves room for continued thinking about political cultural conflic within a new-class framework."

First, the network of regularized communication contact is related to issue-specific discussion patterns and to outcome preference and activation on specific issues. Our anlysis indicates that our measure of the routinized community-affairs discussion network is valid in that it represents a distillation of contact patterns that exist with regard to a variety of specific issues. Moreover, discussion contacts among the elite on routine, instrumental issues are found to be more closely reflected in the regularized network than are such contacts on unique, value-laden consummatory issues. We also find a moderated degree of ""institutionalization"" of contact patterns and support for an instrumentally orientad ""bargaining"" model of issue resolution in two American communities. Cross-community variations in bases of communication contact discussed in the latter part of the paper suggest that such a model may be associated with the use of business/professional ties in an influence structure, while an ""oppositional"" model may be characteristics of communities in which contact patterns are rooted in informal social relations."

Micro-evidence and theoretical critiques indicate that human cognitive capacity is limited. Hence actor facing complex contingencies rely largely upon tacit assumptions and routine. The routines of physical property and organizational authority are upheld by actors' tacit monitoring of social coalitions. Individuals continuously negotiate such coalitions in chains of interaction rituals in which conversations create symbols of group membership. Every encounter is a marketpace in which individuals tacitly match conversational and emotional resources acquire from previous encounters. Individuals are motivated to move toward those ritual encounters in which their microresources pay the greatest emotional returns until they reach personal equilibrium points at which their emotional returns stabilize or decline. Large-scale changes in social structure are produced by aggregate changes in the three types of microresources: increases in generalized culture due to new communications media or specialized culture-producing activities; new ""techologies"" of emotional production; and new particularized cultures (individual reputations) due to dramatic, usually conflictual, events. A method of macrosampling the distribution of microresources is proposed."

Land AND Marcus Felson,American Journal of Sociology,82,3,1976-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 565-604,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"It is generally agreed that social indicators are measures of social conditions. Accordinlgy, recent interest in measuring social conditions and in building models of how various social forces determine changes in social conditions was predated by work of William F. Ogburn and his collaborators over 50 years ago. In this paper, we argue for a revival of analyses of social change based upon time series of indices of social conditions. To provide a general paradigm for this type of analysis, we describe (1) an opportunity-structures theoretical framework for generating specifications of equations of dynamic macro social indicator models, (2) a demographic accounting framework for grounding such equations in population stocks and flows, and (3) a structural equation strategy for estimating and evaluating the resulting models. To illustrate this paradigm, we present analyses of three equation determining changes in the national reported property crime rate, the reported violent crime rate, and the rate of public police expenditures. The equations fit annual 1947-72 time-series data well, yield theoretically meaningful coefficients, and lack demonstrable autocorrelation of disturbances. Moreover, the conditional forecasts of the 1973 values of the reported crime rates fall well within bounds set by the standard errors of the equations."

Seltzer,American Journal of Sociology,96,4,1991-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 895-929,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"This article investigates the effects of legal custody arrangements on the amount of child support fathers pay after divorce, contrasting the experiences of families in which parents share authority over children through jont legal custody and those in which mothers have sole legal custody. It argues that join legal custody encourages similarities between the way divorced fathers and fathers in two-parent households invest in their children. The analysis used data from a representative sample of recent divorces, in which children live with their mothers, to explore the relationship between legal custody and legal child-support obligations (awards) and to investigate the effects of the type of custody on child-support payments. Joint legal custody is associated with higher support awards, but the association is explained by the higher incomes of fathers with joint custody. Legal custody arrangements do not affect levels of child-support payments when family characteristics and the amont of child support awarded at divorce are taken into account. Legal custody does,however, alter the process governing fathers' contributions to child support. Parents' incomes have a larger effect, and child-supprt awards a smaller one, on payments among families with joint legal custody, suggesting that joint legal custody may allow fathers greater discretion about contributions to child support. By stengthening ties between divorced fathers and children, join legal custody may increase the correspondence between parents' and children's socioeconomic status and result in greater inequality among children of divorce."

Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women’s underinvestment in firm‐specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm‐specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high‐skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women’s disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand‐side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in nonformalized labor markets are discussed."

The authors build a model of within‐county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multilevel methods are used to distinguish county cross‐sectional, state cross‐sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state‐level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross‐sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross‐sectionally."

Strictness makes organizations stronger an more attractive because it reduces free riding. It screens out members who lack commitment and and stimulates participation among those who remain. Rational choice theory thus explains the success of sect, cults, and conservative denominations without recourse to assumptions of irrationality, abnormality, or misinformation. The theory also predicts differences between strict and lenient groups, distinguishes between effective and counterproductive demands, and demonstrates the need to adapt strict demands in response to social change."

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change."

Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non‐NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized. The findings have implications for future research on labor unions and represent an important step toward an empirical understanding of processes of institutionalization within social movements generally."

Group testing methods are used, but they are geared to procedures which tend to eliminate such bias as is usually associated with the recruitment of test-room groups of the general public. (2) Measuring effects: The second technique described is a new process for measuring the effect of a television (or radio) broadcast. Exposure to the broadcast is in to way controlled or stimulated, and the effect as measured tends to be independent of experimental influences. Each of the two methods here described is usable in fields other than broadcasting (e.g., in social campaigning, in propaganda, in advertising)."

Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be “one who aspires.”"

Quantitative cross‐national data on a more recent wave of democratizations, from 1989 to 1996, confirm these findings. Models using direct maximum‐likelihood estimation find that the ratio of adults with higher education has a significant positive effect on change in democracy levels, as measured by two longitudinal scales (Polity IV and Polyarchy). Proxies for the working class and the middle class—candidates proposed in previous studies as the social basis of democratization—also have significant effects."

They argue that accounting played a key technical role in enhancing rationality and furthering the development of capitalism methods of production. The history of accounting methods and practices from the Middle Ages to the 19th century is surveyed in order to evaluate these arguments. Two important dimensions of accounting are discussed: the rhetorical and the technical. The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures. Goody's analysis of writing and literacy is applied to the development of accounting as a technique. As a practical method, double-entry bookkeeping appears to have increased ""rationality,"" but the rhetorical side of double entry is also critical. The conclusion is that the significance of double-entry bookkeeping can be appreciated only if its rhetorical and technical aspects are considered."

Traditional resolutions of this paradox are inadequate; the resolution proposed here involves the distinction within the sphere of production between the labor process and the factory regime. By a series of comparisons of textile industries in 19th-century England, United States, and Russia, the article highlights four factors that shape factory regimes: the labor process, market forces, the reproduction of labor power, and the state. It shows how an examination of factory regimes can account for the absorption of working-class radicalism in England after 1850 and the deepening of working-class radicalism in Russia after 1905, culminating in the revolution-ary movements of 1917. Finally, it presents the implications for Marxism of this distintion between the strictly economic elements of production and its political and ideological institutions."

On the four dimensions of social distance-normative, interactive, cultural, and personal-ministers are closest, physicians are more distant, and psychotherapists are the most distant from their clients. Stable interaction between client and professional is most likely when internalized norms, common expectations, and optimum cathexis exist among the role partners. These conditions are best met by the physician-patient pair, less well met by ministers and counselees, and least of all by psychotherapists and patients. Social proximity and distance each have advantages and disadvantages in maintaining the conditions of stable interaction. Mechanisms which bridge the social distance gap yet keep professionals from too high an involvement with clients are described. For psychotherapists, a community of ""friends and supporters of psychotherapy"" serves this purpose.

Two empirical cases: the mobilization against U.S. President Roland Reagan's visit in Berlin in 1987 and the mobilization against the yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Berlin in 1988 are investigated to develop hypotheses that indicate what structural and cultural factors are important to a successful mobilization.

The likelihood that the probation officers will submit more cases from minority groups than from Anglos for formal court hearings is reduced below levels of statiscal signigicance when appropriate considerations are taken into account-except for those for whom extensive handling seems most logical. The likelihood that the judge will send more minority-group members than Anglos to the youth authority, however, persists for most categories of offenders even when these considerations are taken into account. The biases appear to consist largely of letting Anglos ""get off easy"" rather than of requiring uncalled-for ""treatment"" for minority-group members. Overall, the findings suggest that about two-thirds of the differential handling in the court studied is not explained by appropriate considerations."

Equal employment opportunity law, occupational safety and health legislation, and fringe benefits regulation were designed to create employee rights to equal protection, to health and safety, and to the benefits employers promise. In event‐history analyses of data from 279 organizations, this research finds that these legal changes stimulated organizations to create personnel, antidiscrimination, safety, and benefits departments to manage compliance. Yet as institutionalization proceeded, middle managers came to disassociate these new offices from policy and to justify them in purely economic terms, as part of the new human resources management paradigm. This pattern is typical in the United States, where the Constitution symbolizes government rule of industry as illegitimate. It may help to explain the long absence of a theory of the state in organizational analysis and to explain a conundrum noted by state theorists: the federal state is administratively weak but normatively strong."

Semiotic and linguistic theory is used to expose essential properties associated with the successful communication of meaning in each context. The authors find that e‐mail requires the cultivation of new techniques for specifically conveying the “pragmatic information” that connects the meaning of words to their users. Such information is assigned in e‐mail through the use of what are termed emphatic, referential, and characterizing semiotic tactics. These tactics are also evident in sustained online interactions studied by other researchers. This theoretical vocabulary represents an alternative to the dominant sociological characterization of e‐mail as an inferior substitute for face‐to‐face interaction."

Quantitative analyses of individual and job-level data in a state government pay system indicate that the administered efficiency model does not adequately explain malefemale earnings differences. Documentary, testimonial, and interview data strongly suggest the significance of bureaucratic politics in the pay-determination process.

As interest shifted from physical structures and traits to social relations and processes, the natural history of race relations was outlined; racial prejudice was seen as a subjective aspect of interrupted racial processes; impersonal factors and processes were isolated; and the analysis of marginality gave an understanding of differential racial status within and among racial groups. The present need is for study of collective behavior in relation to personality development and racial change."

Lindesmith,American Journal of Sociology,43,4,1938-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 593-613,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Current theories of drug addiction tend to be moralistic rather than scientific. Any satisfactory theory must attempt to account for the fact that the repeated administration of opiates sometimes is followed by addition and sometimes is not. The factor which accounts for this differential effect appears to be the person's knowledge or belief, supplied him by his cultural milieu, concerning the nature of the distress that accompanies the sudden cessation of the opiate. If he fails to realize the connection between this distress and the opiate he escapes addiction, whereas if he attributes the discomfort to the opiate and thereafter uses the opiate to alleviate it he invariably becomes addicted. Addiction is generated in the process of using the drug consciously to alleviate withdrawal distress. No exceptions to this theory could be found. It is confirmed by analysis of certain aspects of addict argot and by the consideration of certain types of crucial cases. The theory provides a simple means of accounting for many aspects of the habit. It is methodologically significant in that it is based upon case data and is at the same time universal in form and subject to definite verification or disproof."

The most impressive empirical documentation of this link at the aggregate level has come from time-series analyses. Studies at the individual level have begun to specify the causal elements in such relations, with emphasis on the variable health outcomes of economic deprivation. Specifying the duration of effect, however, requires longitudinal data. Such studies are still rare in the field and most are too limited in time span to test duration hypotheses. Using one of the oldest known achieves of longitudinal data, this study examines the consequences of the Great Depression experiences of middle-and working-class women for their well-being in old age, 40 years later. Adaptations to human and material loss in the 1930s varied widely by social class, reflecting the greater severity of economic stress and the greater resource disadvantage of working-class families. With health measurements before the Depression and some 40 years later, the results show consistently adverse effects of economic loss for working-class women and benign outcomes among women of higher status. These long-term implications of decremental change point to the need for greater understanding of the life course in studies of the interplay of social history and life history."

Data on the occurrence of conflicts and of violence against various ethnic or racial groups in the 81 largest cities, 1880-1914, show that the growth of the union movement and the rising supply of low-wage labor increased levels of ethnic competition in urban labor markets, thus raising rates of ethnic comflict. The findings support the argument that ethnic conflict and labor unrest are parallel forms of collective action and that each depends on the number and foundings of national labor unions. The effect of labor union organization is strongest for all attacks on blacks. In addition, sharp increases in immigration, a downturn in economic fortunes, and contagion processes all raise rates of ethnic conflict."

Diverse social roles emerge from the dynamics of the system: leaders are individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a considerable fraction of the population, conformists are unsatisfied cooperative agents that keep cooperating, and exploiters are defectors with a payoff larger than the average one obtained by cooperators. The dynamics generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network. The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime. But disruptions affecting leaders produce social crises described as dynamical cascades that propagate through the network."

This is illustrated with an agent‐based model of mutual social influence on domestic water demand. The consequences for many frequently used statistical techniques are discussed."

What would constitute an electoral crisis is, foremost, an indecisive contest, and, secondarily, a failure by the electoral vote winner to capture a plurality of the popular vote. A number of proposals for electoral reform have been advanced, ranging from simple alterations of the present Electoral College system to comprehensive reformations such as adopting a district plan, proportional division of the electoral vote, or direct popular election of the president. In this paper we investigate how the impact of various social groups on the outcome of a presidential contest would be altered under each of the reform proposals. A simulation methodology is used, with baseline data on group voting obtained from the 1960 contest between Kennedy and Nixon. Our results indicate that, in comparison with the popular vote, the Electoral College advantages the following population groups: large-state residents, metropolitan area residents, Negroes, Catholics, and possibly low-income persons. The district and proportional plans, by generally disadvantaging these populations relative to the popular vote, would build a reverse bias into the electoral system."

Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the globalization of bankruptcy law has proceeded through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law."

Instead it appears that public policies such as the Wagner Act and Social Security led to union and business support for private insurance, which in turn spurred to growth of fringe benefits. The historical record suggests that neoinstitutional and conflict approaches must be synthesized to explain the expansion of fringe benefits: institutional factors influenced organizational outcomes by affecting interest group goals."

The roughly 4,000 such women included in the National Election Studies of 1952-88 provide an unusual opportunity for testing whether general historical conditions during childhood and adolescence have enduring effects. Despite common claims of cohort effects, some scholars remain skeptical because cohort effects are notoriously difficult to distinguish from age and period effects. Nineteenth Amendment women were in fact less likely to vote in the 1952-88 elections and this gender gap is unique to the amendment cohorts. These results provide strong evidence for the enduring effects of a cohort's historical conditioning."

Significant factors include whether the mother was pregnant at marriage, her age at marriage, and her experience with marital disruption and remarriage. The analysis is conducted within an event-history framework that controls for other features of the parental home, including socioeconomic status and religious affilaition. The evidence suggests that the children of mothers who married young and were pregnant at marriage entered into their own marital and nonmarital unions significantly earlier than others. The experience of parental marital dissolution increases children's nonmarital cohabitations but has little effect on their marriages. While no single causal mechanism can easily account for all of the empirical data, the combination of different attitudes toward marriage, nonmarital sex, and cohabitation can account for the empirical findings."

Because organizations are designed by architects possessing bounded rationality, they must adapt to circumstances unforeseen at their founding. They may also be pushed in unexpected directions by the influential actors in their environments, the power of professionals, and the propensity to routinization. International regimes, which are partly made up of organizations, may therefore be prone to internal contradictions."

This paper examines the additive and interactive influence of these two groups of variables using a sample of fix time points (every five years from 1950 to 1975) for 18 relatively developed nations. Models are estimated by using generalized least squares which relate labor force participation of males aged 65 and over to such variables as the size of the agricultural labor force, the old-age dependency ratio, government revenues, social insurance and pension benefits, coverage of the population by pension systems, and the existence of means and retirement tests. The results show dominant effects from the nonpolicy variables that relate to occupational changes in industrial economies and secondary effects from policy-manipulable variables such as pension expenditures that can be changed to increase labor force participation rates and ease the strain on social security systems."

In the capital goods industry the attempt was unsuccessful and generated serious political opposition to the regime among local entrepreneurs, thus illustrating the extent to which processes of class formation lie outside the control of even a relatively powerful state apparatus. In the petrochemical industry the existence of a powerful state enterprise within the sector was critical to the state's ability to restructure the industry. What resulted was neither a ""reinvention of the bourgeoisie"" nor the creation of a ""state capitalist"" sector but, rather, an interesting oligopolistic community in which state and private local capital are thoroughly integrated and similarly organized. It is suggested that focusing on the concrete forms of such oligopolistic communities represents the most promising strategy for understanding the local side of dependent capitalist development."

Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks’ transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept.

Instead, it is continually remade—and is being reworked today—suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification."

Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially and became the province (e.g., in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs (CDOs in which the underlying assets are ABSs) emerged, they were evaluated in two separate stages. This created a fatally attractive arbitrage opportunity, large-scale exploitation of which sidelined previously important gatekeepers (risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of mortgage-backed securities) and eventually magnified and concentrated the banking system’s calamitous mortgage-related losses."

Further, a variety of survey studies, including a major unpublished one by Gouldner, indicate that sociologists as a group have been the most left-disposed field in academe, an occupation which is to the left of other strata. Within sociology, the ""achievers,"" those at the most prestigeous schools, who have published most, and have the most research funds, are to the left of others in the field. This pattern reflects a general characteristics of intellectual life in which the most successful people hold more unorthodox socially critical views, behavior which may stem from a link between creativity and heterodoxy. The fact that sociology is to the left of other fields may be inherent in the subject material it deals with, its distrust of reason, and its role as a debunker."

This thesis challenges those theories which claim that the importance of class conflicts declined under state socialism and that therefore such societies should be described as containing nonantagonistic classes or strata. It also challenges the critical theories which acknowledge the existence of a new dominant class in Eastern Europe, but which describe that class as the bureaucracy or technobureaucracy. This paper attempts to base its class analysis on the exploration of the mechanisms and institutions of expropriation of surplus under state socialism. It is suggested that in contemporary Eastern Europe private ownership and market mechanisms of expropriation have been replaced by central planning and redistribution of the economic surplus. All those who have vested interests in the maximization of redistributive power are members of a new dominating class. If we define the new class this way it will include more than just the bureaucracy; potentially, it includes the whole intelligentsia. The paper describes the new dominant class of intelligentsia as a class in statu nascendi. The formation of this class takes a whole historical epoch. In the first stage of state-socialist development the Djilas thesis is basically accurate: under Stalinism and in the early post-Stalinist years the bureaucracy had the monopoly of power. During the last two decades, on the other hand, the social base of power holders has broadened, especially in those countries which experimented with economic and political reforms. The formation of a new dominant class which incorporates the whole of the intelligentsia is now under way."

Four hypotheses regarding the effect of a father's absence are tested: the ""no-effects"" hypothesis, the ""economic-deprivation"" hypothesis, the ""father-absence"" hypothesis, and the ""family-stress"" hypothesis. Separate analyses are presented for black and whites. The findings indicate that growing up in a female-headed family increases the risk of poverty, but not because of father absence per se. Among whites, economic deprivation and the stress associated with recent family disruption account for nearly all the negative effects of family structure on offsprings' attainment, whereas among black the results are more mixed."

Educational inequality diminishes the positive effect of income inequality on activism and has a strong negative effect on the crime rate.

In 1913, defending the ""principal ideas"" of that work, Durkheim supported his conception of the ""duality of human nature"" (simultaneously social and individual) by emphasizing the ""dynamogenic quality of religion,"" its ability to inspire human aciton a well as to curb it. These arguments do not represent a straighforward development of Durkheim's earlier work but must be undestood within the borader intellectual context within which he worked. Of particular importance were the growing differences among British social anthropologists, notably William Robertson Smith and James Frazer, concerning the mythic or utilitarian nature of primitive religion. On the evidence of this context, it is argued that one of the most critical shifts in the development of Durkheim's sociology of religion took place only after 1900. The process by which Durkheim developed his arguments in support of the former position may be understood in the light of recent work associated with the ""strong programme"" in the sociology of science. Major contemporary works used by Durkheim can be viewed as exemplars and the basis for analogies between substantively different areas of work rather than as the product of the application of a generalizable sociological method."

Primary minority groups are the result of a new relationship established between two pre-existing functioning social systems through annexation of a territory with its population or more rarely through group migration.

Our analysis compared the attitudes of a sample of soldiers in the all-volunteer army in 1973 with those of soldiers in the conscription-based army of World War II. We found that representative samples of enlisted men in 1943 were more positively oriented toward their jobs than are the soldiers of the 1970s. Some similarities were observed between World War II AWOLs and soldiers in the all-volunteer force.

Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of “contentious” political action. Instead, to establish tribes’ status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians."

The major function of the cocktail lounge was the facilitation of casual sexual affairs between high-status married men and young, unattached women. The organization of the cocktail lounge is described, and the relationship between activities in the lounge and outside social ties is discussed."

In the relationship between status and education, important departures from linearity may occur as a result of certification screening (of preference) by employers; yet many researchers have virtually ignored this process and the possibility that it may serve several functions. Data from the 1977 NORC General Social Survey show that academic certification has a substantial impact on occupational prestige and (more ambiguously) on respondent's income, independently of years of school completed and other predictors; this impact appears to vary according to age of respondent. In conclusion, the status-attainment proces in the United States may depart substantially from the ""rational choice"" model favored by human capital theory."

The problem of transmission is complicated by movements and migration of peoples and by the rapidity of social change, due to technological advances. Cultural crises arise when the tradition transmitted, including the folkways and mores and the religious beliefs, no longer conform to the more secular interests and practices of everyday life. When the younger generation loses cultural contact with the elder, or when one section or class of the community ceases to function in conformity with the interest and ideals of the community as a whole, the problem of education is to re-establish communication and to reweave the web of intimate and personal relations of individuals, constituting the older and younger generations, as well as the diverse regions, in order to achive understanding and revive the loyalties upon which the moral, as distinguished from the economic and political order, rest. It is the function of news and, more especially, of art, literature, and the humanities to create the understandings which make for moral unity solidarity in the community, in so far as it can be created and maintained by art, literature, and formal education."

A cross‐sectional, time‐series, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios (municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10‐year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios. These results suggest that the curvilinear relationship between the structure of political opportunities and protest mobilization posited to explain social movements in well‐developed Western democracies does not explain the development of the protest cycle of a new social movement in an emerging electoral democracy."

The conclusion is that the Ottoman and Iranian legal assemblies, which were buttressed by extraparaliamentary and extralegal resources, were far more powerful and effective.

Are these neighborhood preferences color‐blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."

The article shows that the study is potentially affected by selectivity at several junctures: in determining who complied with the program’s requirements, who entered integrated versus segregated neighborhoods, and who left neighborhoods after initial relocation. Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self‐sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments. With this method, they find evidence that neighborhood is associated with outcomes such as employment, earnings, TANF receipt, and use of food stamps."

The socially shared presuppositions they brought to their reading caused West Indian reviewers to interpret Lamming's novels as involving questions of personal and national identity, British reviewers to concentrate on the novels' language and literary qualities, and American reviewers to emphasize race. Each of Lamming's novels exercises a different degree of ""cultural power,"" and this capacity to engender multiple meanings while retaining coherence shows that cultural meanings emerge from the interaction between cultural works of varying power and human recipients of varying expectations and concerns. In turn, this interaction suggests a theory of metaphor that enables research in the sociology of culture to utilize both cultural and sociological data without reducing one to the other."

Jewish education until the Enlightenment consisted mainly of rote learning and casuistic interpretation of sacred texts. It remained medieval in spirit longest where the opportunities for participation in capitalistic secular culture were most restricted. In more recent times the increasing migration of Jews to the urban areas of advanced capitalistic nations has tended to weaken the influence of religious education with all but the nationalist groups. For the most part, Jewish learning now serves only as a supplement to the secular public education. The contrast between the highly urbanized, sophisticated Jews and the Negroes is great.

Second, the type of control group used was correlated with the measured effect of desegregation: studies which used random-assignment experimental designs found significantly stronger treatment effects, while studies which compared black achievement growth either to that of white students or to achievement test norms found much weaker (usually negative) treatment effects.

His expressions and reactions, seemingly bizarre and irrelevant, are attempts to state a real problem. To understand his attitudes and behavior it is necessary to examine his ""inner"" life; this points back to his past, to his outer world as it once existed. Each new situation in the past has added some element to this petterned ""inner"" life as we see it now. Elaborate life-histories are necessary in reconstructing this past. The approach is not that of the psychiatrist, but an attempt to determine how culture is transmitted and how, from the sociological point of view, the personality in question arose. The nice problem will probably prove to be the relative evaluation of the existing milieu, with its point of significant support and stress, and the force of highly fixed inner definitions tending toward pathological interpretations of existing situations and consequent pathological response."

Older and more formalized movement organizations are more flexible, but the kinds of changes undertaken are not necessarily conservative. The benefits of transformation are limited, however, and organizational change increases the risk of failure with little evidence of a declining effect over time. In the long run, this shapes the organizational system in ways that potentially improve its legitimacy but may also limit the development of an infrastructure for future mobilization."

The authors compare the spreads of two governance innovations adopted in response to the 1980s takeover wave: poison pills (which spread rapidly through a board‐to‐board diffusion process) and golden parachutes (which spread slowly through geographic proximity). The study closes with a discussion of networks as links between individual adaptation and collective structures.

The functionalism that resulted moved in one direction, while social research has progressively moved in an individual-behavioristic direction, resulting in an ever-widening divergence between research and theory. This paper describes paths in research and in theory development, that will reconstitute relevance of each for the other. The essential elements are two. The first is use of a theory of purposive action as a foundation for social theory; this entails acceptance of a form of methodological individualism and rejection of holism. The second is a focus in social research and theory on the movement from the level of individual actions to macrosocial functioning, that is, the level of system behavior."

The present paper argues that the perstige of occupations, as it is ordinarily graded, is a simple average of these two dimensions, implying that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that assessments of prestige do in fact involve considerations of economic reward, an it employs the data in conjunction with this well-grounded assumption to infer what other considerations must be involved. The argument is prosecuted by means of polar coordinate analysis. This method is applicable because R2 for the regression of social standing (taken to be a synonym for prestige) on other aspects of occupation is close to one; and virtually all the variance of each vector of occupational assessment lies in a space of three dimensions. The final discussion suggests that, although the data point to the existence of a normative consensus, this consensus bears little relation to prestige in its traditional prestige which bolsters the elite is a fragile thing, whereas the normative consensus on occupational prestige may constitute an important source of legitimation of the distribution of social rewards."

It is an attempt to hold resources that can be justified by more than one legitimating principle. Property tansformation in postsocialist Hungary involves the decentralized reorganization of assets and the centralized management of liabilities. Together they blur the boundaries of public and private, the boundaries of enterprises, and the boundedness of justificatory principles. Enterprise-level field research, data on the ownership structure of Hungary's 220 largest enterprises and banks, and an examination of the government's recent debt consolidation programs suggest the emergence of a distinctively East European capitalism that will differ as much from West European capitalism as do contemporary East Asian variants."

Through interviews with stakeholders, the author finds that both elites and nonelites deployed informal communication to amplify and to defuse pressure for consensus. Much of the power of informal communication derived from its relation to local knowledge and place‐based networking that was irrelevant in principle to formal process activities—and this was welcomed in one community and resisted in another. These differences highlight the overlooked role of regional‐scale political cultures in light of the increasing formalization of participatory best practices. The article suggests that the study of democratic engagement can gain by exploring the contextual implementation of abstract deliberative ideals such as inclusion, publicity, and transparency."

Hypotheses are derived from the international migration literature and the market transition debate. The results are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from cumulative causation of migration; however, geographical location creates some differences in migration patterns to the United States. In China as in Mexico, the existence of migration networks increases the propensity of migration for others in the community. In contrast to the Mexican case, among Chinese immigrants, having a previously migrated household member increases the propensity of other household members to migrate only after the debt for previous migration is paid off. In step with market transition theory, the authors also find that political power influences the migration experience from the coastal Fujian Province."

Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market—a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action problems. The author develops a different account by viewing institutions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing conflict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental certification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market‐based approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the “political construction of market institutions.” The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms."

This article presents archival and statistical evidence that partisan control of policy‐making institutions—namely, Republican control of “veto points” in the legislative process—is associated with a substantial reduction in the likelihood that a state would pass FEP legislation, even when controlling for potentially confounding variables. This finding casts doubt on the leading account of the electoral realignment that began in the mid‐1960s and culminated in the Reagan‐Bush years. Well before the advent of affirmative action, key numbers of GOP officeholders—allied with organized business and motivated by a free‐market, antiregulatory ideology—worked successfully to block the adoption of color‐blind laws mandating formal racial equality."

Consequently, these interpreters have critized positions that are attributed to Mead but which he did not propose. The social behaviorist interpretation of the ""I"" is more consistent with the textual evidence. By extending and slightly reformulating Mead's theory, the latter part of the paper aims to show that the social behaviorist interpretation is also more theoretically fertile and methodologically applicable."

The fields of art and science were considered essentially antithetical in methodology as well as in practice. Art was the product of the intuition of the privileged man, and science of the disciplined reason which almost anyone could exercise. Although the ""great man theory"" of art still lingers, there is evidence of an interest in the social analysis of aesthetic culture. Aesthetic culture has been variously conceived as a ""social luxury,"" as a reflection of its age, as an autonomous experience, as an escape from personal disorganization. From the critique of these theories it is apparent that beauty is a folkway that is buttressed by rationalizations that are linked to certain circumstances. It is almost more plausible to state that the theory of art is socially conditioned that that art itself is so determined."

Drawing on a qualitative study of the Boston legal market, we argue that this barrier reflects a situation where loyalty norms have been violated, and it surfaces because service to individual plaintiffs is tantamount to betraying the interests of corporate clients. Our analysis clarifies identity-based limits to diversification, indicating that they are rooted in concerns about the firm’s commitments as well as its capabilities, and suggests a more general refinement of theory on status and conformity."

Of special importance are the contrasting effects of Christian democracy and social democracy on transfer payments, social benefits expenditure, and total government revenue. There is also a strong effect of constitutional structure on welfare state effort, a finding that provides the first solid support for the state-centered perspective in a quantitative analysis."

Radio does not make us congregate.-Radio does not satisfy man's desire to congregate with other persons in the mutual enjoyment of music, games, etc. Broadcasting cannot compete with other amusements.-Broadcasting does not encourage association or herding, and can, therefore, never compete injuriously with the theater, the concert, the church, or the motion picture.

Since lottery tickets are assets with negative expected return, lottery play challenges the basic assumptions of economic theory. This article approaches lottery play from a networks perspective and focuses on syndicate play. A comparison of the development of lottery markets in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Portugal from the 17th century onward shows that lottery play declined with rising incomes except in countries in which syndicate play diffused widely, namely, Spain, and to a lesser extent, Portugal. Although syndicating originated among the relatively poor as a response to an increase in lottery prices, it persisted even when individual play became affordable. This article contends that syndicating endured because of an institutionalization process by which lottery tickets have transformed from purely economic assets into symbolic carriers of interpersonal ties that convey membership and status position in relevant social networks."

The game-theoretic solution centers on the opportunity for tacit collusion in repeated play. However, not all actors grasp the strategic implications of future interaction. Accordingly, this study reformulates the game as a stochastic learning model in which the behavior of interdependent actors is constinually shaped by sanctions and cues generated by their interaction. Computer simulations of a two-person game show that adaptive actors are led into a social trap more readily than are fully rational actors, but they are also better at finding their way out. Prosocial norms appear to be a consequence rather than cause of cooperation but useful in promoting forgiveness of random deviance. The model is then elaborated as an N-way Prisoner's Dilemma. Simulations show how the effects of network size, density, mobility, and anonymity derive from a fundamental principle of collective action, that is, the need to reduce the number of choices that must be fortuitously coordinated in order to escape noncooperative equilibrium. The results also suggest how network structure might evolve in tandem with the cooperation it facilitates."

Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of ""connection"" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types."

A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically."

Anomie observed was related to the extend of industrialization, but place in the skill hierarchy and the pattern of system involvement were associated with anomie differently in each country. In the less developed countries, beliefs concerning societal anomie were not related to skill level or pattern of system involvement, as in the United States, but to political ideology and the ability of workers to see effective linkages between union and national politics."

Within a few moments, the highly integrated collectivity that has dominated its individual members (prejump phase) changes drastically into a tenuous, anomic social situation that gives rise to a very egocentric individuality followed by a return to the former state (postjump phase). This bipolarity of parachuting provides a rare opportunity to study a nearly ideal-typical manifestation of extreme opposite social forms contained within a organizational setting. The sequence of the three phases of the jump, and the dialectical relationship among them, is analyzed here in terms of personal regression leading to social regression, and vice versa. The ambivalence of these relatioships becomes evident in the functional analysis of parachuting's radical implications for individuals as well as for the group and the larger (military) organization."

The author introduces a set of GIS variable construction techniques that are designed to accomplish these tasks, illustrates these techniques empirically by using them to test spatial proximity hypotheses drawn from the literature on environmental inequality, and demonstrates that results obtained using these techniques are methodologically superior to and substantively different from results obtained using traditional techniques. Finally, the author demonstrates that these techniques are the product of an alternative conceptualization of physical space that allows sociologists to develop new ways to think about and measure spatial relationships, ecological context, and place‐based social inequality and that gives them the ability to reconceptualize spatially based methodological problems that have confronted them for years."

The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field—the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks—determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries.

A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach."

The results show that a chosen firm is most strongly influenced by comparable others when it faces scale‐based competition and is diversified. The implications of this study are twofold: a social actor’s sensitivity to the conduct of others may depend not only on its place in a hierarchy but also on the nature of its ties to an external audience; and a contingent theory of social influence may be necessary to characterize diffusion processes correctly, particularly when external and time‐varying nonnetwork factors have significant effects."

It proposes that the model of the youth culture as a contraculture does not point to many  of the most distinctive properties of the adolescent subculture. In order to appreciate the differences between adult and adolescent orientations to social reality, we mustlook at the meanings that peer-group norms have for adolescents. From this perspective, the youth culture is a genuinely independent subculture: The socialcategories inherent in the adolescent status teminology provide the members of this age-grade with their own world view, life styles, and moral standards."

Weber, however, has remained an enigma in this respect. This article addresses Weber’s approach to the environment, including its significance for his interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to constructing a meaningful postexemptionalist sociology."

This raises the question of the place of genetics in social science explanations. Genomic causation is described from a counterfactualist perspective, which makes its complexity plain and highlights the distinction between identifying causes and substantiating explanations. For explanation, genomic causes must be understood as strictly mediated by the body. One implication is that the challenge of behavioral genetics for sociology is much more a challenge from psychology than biology, and a main role for genetics is as a placeholder for ignorance of more proximate influences of psychological and other embodied variation. Social scientists should not take this challenge from psychology as suggesting any especially fundamental explanatory place for either it or genetics, but the contingent importance of genetic and psychological characteristics is itself available for sociological investigation."

Further studies with different types of respondents and different innovations should yield a scheme for classifying the item which is bein adopted and thus permit better prediction of the diffusion process."

Reputations depend on the ""embeddedness"" of interactions in structures or networks of social relations. They illustrate the effects of such embeddedness on the outcomes of interactions.This article presents simple game-theoretic models of reputation effects on efficiency (in the Pareto sense) in interactions. In a comparative perspective, the authors start with a baseline model of a social system in which reputation effects (of a specific kind) are excluded: actors do not receive information on their partners' behavior in interactions with third parties. Such a system of ""atomized interactions"" is compared to a system with interactions that are ""perfectly embedded"": actors are immediately informed on all interactions of their partners with third parties.Efficiency is more easily attained as a result of individually rational behavior in perfectly embedded systems. In a final step, the comparative perspective is broadened, and the extreme assumptions of either an atomized or a perfectly embedded social system replaced. Intermediate cases arise in the consideration of ""imperfect embededness,"" that is, a situation in which actors are informed only after some time lag on the behavior of their partners vis-a-vis third parties. It is shown that the conditions for efficiency become more restrictive as the information time lag lengthens."

This article argues that, while internal cohesiveness is indeed critical, bureaucratic rule following can produce results in the opposite direction, depending on the interagency relations that obtain within the state. The effect of interagency relations is demonstrated through an examination of India and Korea. Both have worked to foster industrialization, and both are endowed with relatively healthy bureaucracies. However, the Indian state was paralyzed and fragmented, while its Korean counterpart did secure the requisite internal coherence. Not only did the culture of rule following fail to generate a cohesive state in India, but it, in fact, worked against such an outcome."

Findings consistently show a significant reciprocal relationship between gun ownership levels and the homicide rate, with crime pushing up gun ownership and gun ownership in turn pushing up the homicide rate. Greater certainty of arrest and conviction for homicide has a significant negative effect on the homicide rate, suggesting a deterrent effect of legal sanctions, while the homicide rate in turn has a negative effect on the certainty of punishment. This is consistent with a hypothesis of the strain on cirminal justice system resources resulting from increasing crime. Further, the hypothesis that the imprisonment o criminal offenders has an incapacitative effect on homicide rates independent of deterrence effects is supported. Contrary to the recent findings of Ehrlich (1975b), the analysis fails to detect consistent evidence of a deterrent effect of capital punishment on U.S. homicide rates for 1947-73. This may be because of the infrequency of executions during this period."

The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies."

It shows that in discussing content and interorganizational relationships, the newsman can only invoke his news judgment; however, he can claim objectivity by citing procedures he has followed which exemplify the formal attributes of a news history or a newspaper. For instance, the newsman can suggest that he quoted other people instead of offering his own opinions.

This constitutive difficulty presents itself today in ways that have instructive parallels to the problem constellation confronting the first generation of 20th-century sociological classics. Karl Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929) was extraordinarily successful in Germany at the historical turning point of the Weimar Republic. This marks him as a representative figure among those contemporaries who acknowledged the force of ""irrationalist"" criticisms of progressive liberalism but sought to contain the destructive dynamics of such criticisms within a new type of rational framework, both intellectual and political. The article contrasts Mannheim's encounters with antirationalist thought in Ideologie un Utopie with the later pragmatist instrumental rationalism of his writings in English exile. In analyzing the shift, special attention is paid to Mannheim's involvement in Paul Tillich's religious socialist circle and to confrontations between Mannheim and Georg Lukacs, Oscar jaszi, Eduard Heimann, Max Hrkheimer, and Theodor W. Adorno. Newly discovered letters and transcripts are use to specify these relationships. Mannheim's promising theoretical beginnings were disruped by the brute facts of his generation's biography. Learning from Mannheim requires retrieval of his achievements, criticism of its distortions, and renewed start in the direction of his work during the 1920s."

High school quality is less persistent over time than student-body composition, and plays a minor role in the determination of ultimate educational attainment."

It argues that Afro-Colombian activists were able to seize upon changes in global policy norms around multiculturalism and state disequilibrium both by deploying traditional social movement strategies and by framing their demands in terms of ethnic difference. This case extends our understanding of how social movements make strategic use of political openings and also illustrates the circumstances under which an ethnic difference framing can be a more effective political strategy for achieving rights for black populations than a racial equality framing."

This paper argues that, is our present of foreseeable state of knowledge, such rank orderings are not empirically meaningful. When the comparison is based on efficiency (the ability to solve current problems) the insuperable difficulty is similar to that encountered in what economists call ""interpersonal comparison of utility."" When the criterion is flexibility in dealing with possible future problems, uncertainty of prediction in system environments is a crucial obstacle which, even in principle, cannot be overcome. Evidence is cited from nonlinear models in mathematical ecology to support this argument. It is claimed that this critique is related to but independent of previous arguments against developmental theories."

A functional analysis of poverty thus comes to many of the same conclusions as radical sociological analysis, demonstrating anew Merton's assertion that functionalism need not be conservative in ideological outlook or implication."

Since the early 1950s Taiwan has received massive foreign aid and investment, but it has also had one of the highest sustained rates of growth in the world, while income inequality on the island has decreased substantially. An examinatin of this deviant case is pursued by consideration of the various mechanisms dependency theorists claim are responsible for the linkage of foreign economic penetration to stagnation and inequality. In the Taiwan case, none of these mechanisms work out as predicated. Instead, a variety of factors-including the nature of the Japanese colonial experience, the emphasis on labor-intensive enterprise, and the absence of an entrenched burgeoisie-created a situation in which both rapid growth and increasing equality could occur. Consideration of Taiwan draws attention to flaws in the arguments of most dependency theorists and suggests a more optimistic picture for at least some developing societies that have to deal with foreign economic penetration."

Some recent approaches start with and revise an individually focused, rational action framework. While this orientation to building transdisciplinary, multilevel models provides many insights, it fails to capture essential features of social life. The social organization strategy (SOS) framework presented in this article offers a complementary approach to social action in general and decision making in particular. This orientation, a network and event-centered counterpart to rational choice, rests on fundamental principles that distinguish the discipline of sociology: social interaction is the basis of social life, and social networks provide the mechanism (interaction) through which individuals learn about, come to understand, and attempt to handle difficulties. This approach shifts the from individual ""choice"" to socially constructed patterns of decisions, including consultation with others. Utilization research in medical sociology serves as a case for reviewing theoretical approaches to decision making and provides the background necessary to a theoretical exposition of the SOS approach using data from the National Survey of Access to Medical Care (1975-76.) The results support the utility of pursuing the SOS framework."

The other group conceives social nature to be developed through interaction from an active but relatively amorphous and plastic original nature. The basic differences between the two groups of students seem to be inherent and irreconcilable, but the fundamental character of the disagreement is not always recognized."

This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the “meritocratic power” of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor’s degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor’s degree alone."

Education must be transformed to close rather than perpetuate this vicious gap between expectation and reality. African schools should train their pupils for adaptation to the African environment. Respect for native values should be maintained along with the equipment for co-operation with the European community. European wealth should be used to provide the basis for fulfilling the claims and needs which Western education has developed.

This study compares prediction from three theoretical perspectives-socialization, structural, and expectation states-in a laboratory experiment on power. Males and females were assigned to the high or low position of structural power/dependency in power-imbalanced dyads, with a partner of the same or opposite sex and with power assignments based on competence (legitimation) or chance. The results indicate that the sex of the more powerful person did not affects power use. Overall power use was affected primarily by the sex of the less powerful person;it was greater when that dyad member was male. The process of power use (wether behavioral influence was ever attempted, and, if so, what patterns of influence were used) was examined to help explain these findings. This analysis revealed effects of legitimation on the dyads with powerful females and helped to explain the effects of the weaker person's sex on power use. Instead of providing unequivocal support for any one of the three theories, the results suggest that structure, socialization, and status expectations are complexly interrelated in their effects on power use."

A distinction is made between two classes of knowledge: the core, or fully evaluated and universally accepted ideas which serve as the starting points for graduate education, and the research frontier, or all research currently being conducted. Data are presented from a set of empirical studies which show that, at the top and at the bottom of the hierarchy in either cognitive consensus or the rate at which new ideas are incorporated. It is concluded that in all sciences knowledge at the research frontier is a loosely woven web characterized by substantial levels of disagreement and difficulty in determining which contributions will turn out to be significant. Even at the research frontier, however, minimal levels of consensus are a necessary condition for the accumulation of knowledge. Consensus in all sciences is maintained by sociological processes such as the evaluation and reward systems."

This article makes such an attempt with all Western European countries experiencing democratic rule between 1870 and 1939. It seeks (1) to explain what structural and historical features distinguish the breakdown cases from those that remained democratic, and (2) to trace the process of class coalition formation in the transition to democracy and the subsequent breakdown. Moore's thesis does fit, with some modification. All four breakdwn cases were characterized historically by an authoritarian coalition of labor-repressive landlords, the state, and the bourgeoisie that contributed to the breakdown of democratic rule in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast, in none of the democratic survivors did such a coalition materialize. This difference can be traced largely to the strenght of the agrarian elite in the late 19th century. However, in contrast to Moore's characterization of the conservative authoritarian path, the ruling coalition, except in Germany, did not play a modernizing role, and only in Austria can the bourgeoisie be described as a ""dependent"" partner in the coalition. Moreover, because it stops too early, Moore's analysis greatly underplays the role of the organized working class in the transition to democracy and attributes far too positive a role to the bourgeoisie."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and effects of workers’ responses to the changes they confront in their work situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing a fourfold typology of workers’ responses, the author shows how each type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the restructuring of their jobs."

Class values seem significant in determining both the verbal attitudes and the overt social participation in such cases.

The first, commonly associated with ""postindustrial theory,"" sees work as becoming more humanized, more autonomous, less routinized; the second image, associated with Marxist theories of proletarianization, sees work as becoming more routinized and degraded, with less autonomy and responsibility for the worker. The debate between these two perspectives has largely been waged at the theoretical level, with at best anecdotal evidence in support of one side or the other. This study uses national data to make a preliminary assessment of the adequacy of each perspective. The central analytical strategy is to decompose total changes in the degree of proletarianization into two components: an industry-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes in the overall sectoral distribution of the labor force across industries; and a class-composition-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes within given sectors. Contrary to the expectations of postindustrial theory, it is demonstrated that there is a strong and consistent proletarianization process within sectors. This proletarianization process is hidden from view because of the strength of a counteracting process in the industry-shift effect (i.e., the relatively more rapid expansion of those sectors which were relatively less proletarianized in the first place). The paper concludes with a discussion of the likely transformation of the class structure in the remaining part of the century. It is predicted that this counteracting tendency will weaken, and thus a clearer process of aggregate proletarianization should appear in the next decades."

A recent rise in apostasy added a few percentage points to mainline decline. Conversions from mainline to conservative denominations have not changed, so they played no role in the restructuring."

Economists and game theorists are in the process of developing and applying an equilibrium explanation of match formation and separation based on the principle of voluntary pairing under competitive conditions. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current state of these developments. The general existence of patnership structures with the property that no one has an incentive to separate has been established. These equilibrium structures maximize aggregate ""value"" over the set of all feasible match structures in the transferable utility case. According to this pure theory of matching, competition for partners can be expected to yield equilibrium match structures that are both stable and socially efficient, at least under conditions of frictionless certainty. Search-theoretic models that take account of meeting costs and initial uncertainty about match values have been developed to explain separation behavior as a process of shopping for a ""good match."" These models suggest several possible social inefficiencies in the match formation and separation processes. Finally, labor economists have recently provided empirical evidence that supports this view of the process."

Smith,American Journal of Sociology,37,3,1931-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 368-385,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The major problem of social philosophy is the harmony of individual interest and social welfare. Mead thought to facilitate the solution of this problem by showing that as psychological the individual is social. The technique of his psychology is that of role-assumption: by acting as others, one finally becomes others to himself. From oscillating others, ""a generalized other"" arises to constitute from the flowing selves a more or less abiding self. But this self isa ""socius"": reflecting, like a true microcosm, the dissonance as well as the harmony of the societal macrocosm. Mead thought to show as his social philosophy that amelioration flows differentially from his account of the self. In this he was not wholly successful. The self resulting from Mead's analysis is descriptively social but no more ethically so than is the community that begets it; and of the moral quality of actually existing communities Mead had no high opinion. His interest in amelioration flowed from the man he was rather than from his doctrine of the self. His social philosophy is generous; his social psychology probably true; but the two were connected by his personality rather than by his logic."

Religion, social class, and ideology produce sharp distinctions that are incorporated into all aspects of the political life of the country. With pressures from secularization and rising living standards, it can be questioned from secularization and rising living standards, it can be questioned whether current voter loyalties should be solely related to historic ties with parties. A survey conducted in Austria in 1968 demonstrated that, beyond the organizational continuity of parties and the persistence of social cleavages, there was a separate line of continuity for partisan stability associated with the nature of group ties. While the group benefits that come from a particular party are not always evident, the social bonds linking individuals to parties in a sense bypass this political content. Some of the qualities of Austrian political life for example, the lengthy experience of a coalition government that established a system for sharing administrative offices on the basis of party affiliation are unique, but this should not obscure the more general relevance of the findings: that primary group ties continue to have a political importance even when the structural bases of the ties are weakened."

These two related dimensions of political information processing emerge from a detailed content analysis of depth interview transcripts. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the way citizens relate the condition of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and to political authorities. As expected, education plays a central role in explaning these patterns, but there are some surprising interactive linkages between education and patterns of political thought. One specially intriguing finding is that conservatives have significantly lower scores than liberals on indices of differentiation and integration. The ramifications of these findings for survey research methodology and theories of mass political behavior are discussed."

In so far as this margin prevails, co-ordinates developed for the charting of the one field may be taken over for the charting of the other. There are also important divergencies between the two fields. And in so far as the aesthetic and neurotic fields diverge, there must be a corresponding difference in co-ordinates. Freud's perspective, developed primarily for the charting of neurosis, is better suited to the margin of overlap than to the area of divergency. As regards the margin of overlap, two modifications of Freudian co-ordinates are offered: (1) A poem's structure should be discussed as a recipe or synthesis of several motives rather than in terms of one essential motive with all others treated as derivatives from it; (2) Freud's overly patriarchal emphasis obscures the matriarchal factors operating in literary works that symbolize a change of lineage or identity. As regards the area of divergency, Freud's co-ordinates, in stressing the poem as dream, understress the poem as a communicative structure and as a realistic gauging of human situations. Communication, rather than wish fulfilment, is the key term for literary analysis."

Yet there are numerous examples of “unpopular norms” in which people compel each other to do things that they privately disapprove. While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this “false enforcement” in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer’s genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another."

They also maintain that only military spending can play the role of preventing stagnation. These and related hypotheses are tested controlling for the factors of GNP, GNP/capita, and, depending on the hypothesis, the level of either military or nonmilitary spending. While the level of nemployment was found to be associated with the level of military spending as predicted, the rate of growth was found to be negatively associated. Nonmilitary expenditure was found to play a much more significant role in monopoly capitalist economies than does military spending.

This article develops an alternative formulation at the household level, which focuses on cross‐national variation in the extent to which societal institutions influence the rate of events with the potential to change a household’s life conditions via the manipulation of incentives for mobility‐generating events, and the extent to which they mitigate the consequences of these events through social insurance.

It shows that when two groups of children, identical at age 10 on observed factors, experience different neighborhoods during adolescence, those in high‐poverty neighborhoods are more likely to drop out of high school and have a teenage pregnancy than those in low‐poverty neighborhoods. Causal inferences from such associations have been plagued by the possibility of selection bias. Using a new method for sensitivity analysis, these effects are shown to be robust to selection bias. Unobserved factors would have to be unreasonably strong to account for the associations between neighborhood and the outcomes."

Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed."

Though a philosopher, he deserves the attention of the sociologist because of the hypotheses and thought models he offers. Sartre starts from a phenomenologist epistemology. Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that it is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances. Thus, whoever, in man's universal condition, chooses freedom chooses it for everybody. Lately Sartre's view of freedom has been modified in that he attributes greater importance to social and economic conditions surrounding man's choice. Others constitute infringements upon man's freedom. But man needs the other because cannot realize himself except in the other's eyes. Communication is possible only by mutual role-taking. Language is made while it is spoken, not used as a ready-made commodity. In a study of anti-Semitism, Sartre outlines four types-the anti-Semite, the democrat, the authentic Jew, and the inauthentic Jew-which are products of free choice in a more or less constraining environment. He suggests the classless society as the remedy for anti-Semitism. Sartre's ethics may be useful to the teacher of sociology becauses its assumptions are compatible with those of science."

There results a conception of an ideal primitive or folk society. The urbanized, peasant, and tribal society may be compared in part in terms provided by Maine, Durkheim, and Tonnies. The concept of ""culture,"" developed by anthropologists, reflects the integrated body of conventional understandings corresponding to a self-sufficient community, as observed in folk life. Other characteristics of anthropological analysis of society, as contrasted with sociological, similarly expressive of the nature of folk society, are the disposition to represent the society and culture in terms of ""pattern"" or ""structure""; the relatively small development of problems of sampling, the emphasis on formalized kinship institutions, and certain emphasis of meaning in such words as ""status"" and ""class."" These considerations lead toward a recognition of opposing or complementary processes: that by which the ultimate values of a society develop an organization and consistency wich gives a group moral solidarity; and the expansion of the technical and economic system with consequent impairment of the moral organization."

For many leisure is only rest or entertainment, but it is important to life constructively. Beset with dangers, it still is of evolutional value, enabling education, imagination, progressive adventure. Three eras of leisure.-Witness the leisure afforded by long infancy and youth, in some sense the basis of man's superiority. Witness, againg the leisure and culture made possible by slavery domestic and proprietary or socially institutional. Witness, thirdly, the leisure which has been coming to man through automatic machinery, the ""Iron Man,"" and which offers such adventure, such mixed danger and opportunity, as history has never known. The new leisure and industrial democracy.-With this third leisure must be associated the call for an industrial democracy. All democracy would free men from some subjection and insure to all in some measure and to many in large measure the leisure attending the liberation and also the opportunity and importance attending the leisure; and, as to democracy today, with so much automatic and dehumanized instrumentation of life, leisure might properly even be added as a fourth natural right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. The servile class, then, servants, laborers, even soldiers, would participate in the results, benefits, and responsibilities of modern mechanical automatistm. With the new leisure a new culture.-As leisure through non-human instruments must have a quality different from that resting on slavery or on any labor and fatigue of man's own kind, so the culture and adventure enabled or actually incited by it must be different. There is no universal culture, any culture always being a specific answer to the challenge in the peculiar restraining instruments of its time. Thus the challenge of today comes from the Iron Man, the Giant Automaton, and no former culture can answer. Analogously, Virgil may have accompanied Dante, but he could not have replaced him."

The function of the news is to orient the public in regard to events which affect not only public policy but the interests of individual readers. At times when party discipline is maintained the editorial is likely to be successful in directing political action. At times when party discipline is relaxed it is the news rather than the editorial that makes opinion. However, there can be no public opinion, except where there is some fundamental agreement and understanding as to what events, as they happen, are likely to mean, and events have meaning only as one knows what to do about them."

The historical record of the development and spread of nuclear weapons and the recollections of their designers suggest that tacit knowledge is also crucial to nuclear weapons development. Therefore, if design ceases, and if there is no new generation of designers to whom that tacit knowledge can be passed, then in an important (though qualified) sense nuclear weapons will have been uninvented. Their renewed development would thus have some of the characteristics of reinvention rather than simply copying. In addition, knowledge may be lost not only as a result of complete disarmament, but also as a consequence of likely measures such as a nuclear test ban."

Its ministers have become the guardians of a secretarian etic in a denominationalizing organization, in which the ministry itself is, structurally, one of the most distinctly denominational elements.

Moreover, coordinators strengthened local political factions that linked to national politics without eroding the interests of local communities."

Empirical, historical, historical analysis is utilized to explore the relative saliency of three determinants of political power to explain variation in power as defined conceptually and operationally independent from its determinants. The determinants are magnitude, the extent to which the group is tied into economic, political, and social networks, and the degree of mobilization. The aspect of power investigated is the vesting of economic interests, that is, the extent to which the interests of an actor are taken into account by the government in its routine operation. Regression analysis is used to assess the relative explanatory power of the magnitude, network relations, and degree of mobilization of 12 industries on the vesting of economic interests in the U.S. Department of State in the period 1886-1905. Results show that the different components have different explanatory value under varying conditions, depending on the type of interest that is vested. When the State Department was discussing export-related matters the value of exports was the best predictor of vesting, with mobilization having a secondary impact. However, the effect of network relations was notably weak, contrary to predictions of the power-elite perspective. The conclusion stresses the contingent nature of the determinants of political power."

The comparative success of Thailand's bureaucrats and failure of China's can be illuminated in part by considering differences in relationship to the world system, although this is by no means a sufficient explanation. Bureaucrats choose allies in conjuction with possibilities presented by the world system, as well as by such internal factors as the strenght of rival social groups and the continuity of bureaucratic organization.

From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the “epistemic accident,” grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."

Two components of social desirability-""trait desirability"" and ""need for siscal approval""-are examined to assess the extent to which they effect people's responses to several sociological measures (e.g., happiness, religiosity). This analysis reveals that both components of a social-desirability response set, while generally unrelated to one another, are independently related to our dependent variables, people's responses on the various measures. The more important of the two components, trait desirability, is then examined with regard to its effect on the relationship between people's sexual status and the dependent variables. This introduction to the analysis of trait desirability as a test factor tends to specify both the magnitude and the direction of the original relationships involving sexual status. Finally, the results are discussed with regard to their implications for the validity of various sociological measures and the validity of the sociological investigator's findings."

Fernandez,American Journal of Sociology,107,2,2001-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 273-320,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"One of the most popular explanations for the increased wage inequality that has occurred since the late 1970s is that technological change has resulted in a downward shift in the demand for low‐skill workers. This pattern is also alleged to account for the growth in racial inequality in wages over the same period. This article reports on a case study of the retooling of a food processing plant. A unique, longitudinal, multimethod design reveals the nature of the technological change, the changes in job requirements, and the mechanisms by which the changes affect the wage distribution for hourly production workers. This research finds that, indeed, the retooling resulted in greater wage dispersion and that the changes have also been associated with greater racial inequality in wages. However, contrary to the claims of advocates of the skill‐bias hypothesis, organizational and human resources factors strongly mediated the impact of the changing technology. Absent these “high road” organizational choices, this impact on wage distribution would have been even more extreme."

Usual analyses of this phenomenon invoke conceptions of authority to explain it implicitly, or they propose that the asymmetry of clinical discourse relies solely on an institutional basis. In order to discover and analyze interactional aspects of the clinical encounter, comparative studies between institutional and everyday contexts are necessary. This article demonstrates that, through the use of a conversational ""perspective display series,"" which is adapted to the clinical environment, a delivery of ""bad"" diagnosis news can coimplicate the patient's perspective and promote understanding and the appearance of agreement between clinician and patient. In general, describing manifestations of institutional power and authority should include analysis of the ways that participants organize interaction in the first place."

These conditions interacted with the diverse and, in part, contrary value-orientations of the individual conscientious objectors. In this process special social roles and contending interest groups developed. In addition to this unstable social structure, a general pattern of adjstment is discernible, presenting various degrees of accommodation, assimilation, and conflict."

Two-stage regression analyses that control for the endogeneity of treaty membership show that stronger commitments in the form of optional provisions that allow states and individuals to complain about human rights abuses are often associated with improved practices.

The analysis focuses on the role of state laws and regulations in the expansion of the mortgage‐backed securities markets and the development of real estate investment trusts (REITs). These institutional developments represent a series of ad hoc state efforts to “delocalize” residential and commercial property, and embed real estate financing within global capital markets. Rather than viewing globalization as weakening the state, the author argues that the U.S. state’s capacity to influence the degree and development of liquidity is a powerful mechanism of globalization."

The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners."

Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285"

This conclusion suggests that contrary to some views (notably Max Weber’s) social science has a vital role to play in the prescriptive study of values, particularly so‐called “thick ethical concepts” like “leadership,” “courage,” and “neighborhood vitality.”"

For the first time, we are able to take account of the effect of annexation and can see the actual extent to which the expansion of city boundaries tends to mask the ammount of ""decetralization"" or ""suburbanization"" that has been taking place. Considering the nation as a whole, the unajusted data show that rings grew about four and a half times as fast as the cities they surround, and the that these outlying parts of SMSA's captured just over three-fourths of the total increase going to metropolitan areas. When adjusted for annexations by central cities, however, the data reveal that the rings grew over forty times as fast as the cities as bounded in 1950, and that the suburban rings captured almost 97 per cent of the total metropolitan increase. Before annexation was taken into account, 64 SMSA's appeared to have been ""centralizing,"" but this number was reduced to eight when city boundaries were held constant."

(I) All sociologists should use technical terms in the same sense. Terms are to be judged by their serviceability, which is measured in part by disjunctiveness, inclusiveness, and fewness of the concepts proposed. Methodology should tend to lead to fresh discoveries. (2) The process of competition is the physical aspect of the social reality; it determines the spatial and economic organization of human society, and affords a starting-point for the study of other social processes. (3) Conflict and accommodation are processes which involve the ""personal"" type of interaction. Conflict arises out of conflicting claims, and accommodation is the process in which an equilibration of conflict through redefinition of claims is established. (4) Conflict, accommodation, and assimilation are processes in which control is established. Assimilation is the process in which persons develop sympathetic responsiveness to one another's claims. (5) the concepts proposed here are intended to make possible somewhat complete accounts of reactions evoked by social contact. The immediate reduction of the social reality to description in more ultimate terms tends to obscure some of its features. (6) The actual social reality may be abstracted in substantive or in active terms. The reality is in fact a process of becoming, but the concept of becoming, unless broken up into small units connected with types of social interaction, is not serviceable for scientific purposes."

However, there are different levels of distinctness, some more subtle than others. These levels are determined by the theoretical context of the research. Failure to specify the theoretical context creates ambiguity as to the level of distinctness, and leads to the partialling fallacy, in which one controls for variables that are  distinct in terms of appropriate theory. Although this can occur in using any control procedure, it is especially likely to occur in multiple regression, where high-order partial regression coefficients are routinely obtained in order to determine the relative importance of variables. Four major ways in which these regression coefficients can be seriously misleading are discussed. Although warnings concerning multicollinearity are to be found in statistics texts, they are insufficiently informative to prevent the mistakes described here. This is because the problem is essentially one of substantive interpretation rather than one of mathematical statistics per se."

Important differences in the extent of change are observed among Catholics. The sources of these changing characteristics of Detroit families, particularly changing levels of education. Only about 25%-30% of the differential change among religio-ethnic categories can be attributed to such factors. Apart from these considerations, the changing alues of Detroit Catholics are nonetheless significant, and these trends are interpreted as the major source of aggregate social change observed in the Detroit surveys. These results are consistent with other evidence regarding the recent historical movement of Catholics away from what are often considered traditional definitions of family relationships. In addition, the results of this analysis suggest that, although education consistently affects parental values across time, occupation may be declining in its importance as a determinant of those values."

The implications of being in the third era of utopias, of Marxisms, and of the social sciences are explored."

The antecedents of the field are located in a new economic, institutional, and ideological context. But its foundations are laid by a spectrum of gastronomic writings (journalism, cookbooks, proto‐sociological essays, political philosophy, and literary works) that proposed an expansive, nationalizing culinary discourse. It is this discourse that secured the autonomy of the field, determined its operative features, and was largely responsible for the distinctive position of this cultural field."

Antonio,American Journal of Sociology,106,1,2000-07-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 40-87,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Revived Weimar‐era “radical conservatism” and fresh “New Right” and “paleoconservative” theories offer a radical cultural critique of global capitalism and liberal democracy. Expressing a broader retribalization and perceived failure of modernization, their defense of communal particularity attacks the multicultural nation‐state, liberal rights, and universal citizenship. This essay links reactionary tribalism to a recurrent 20th‐century theoretical tendency, the “total critique of modernity”—a fusion of oversimplified Nietzschean and Weberian ideas. Historically, total critique has promoted convergence between right and left, such as the current overlapping facets of “radical conservatism” and “strong‐program postmodernism.” Total critique counters the “historicist” method of “internal critique” and the “communication model” characteristic of reflexive social theory. The discussion uncovers the mediating role of social theory in the problematic relationship of science and partially disenchanted public spheres in plural, democratic cultures."

Some scholars have argued that the affiliates of the various Protestant denominations are becoming more and more alike in their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and in religious behavior and orientations. Hence, they argue, denominational affiliation has little independent impact on either religious or secular behavior. Others have suggested that denominational affiliations continue to be important influences on individual behavior. In this paper we analyze data from a national survey of American Jews wich show that denominational differences are substantial and more influential within this highly educated and acculturated minority than they have commontly been assumed to be. These findings suggest that recent research may have underestimated the potential importance of contemporary denominational differentiation for American religious life."

An alternative model fits the data much better and supports conclusions in marked contrast to those stated. Contrary to the model suggested in Delinquency in a Birth Cohort, the relation between achievement level and delinquency status is not a spurious one due to a common association with race. Moreover, achievement appears to be at least as strongly related to delinquency status as are race and social class."

A theoretical model suggests that changes in fluidity are normally driven by cohort rather than period effects. The results support this argument: changes in fluidity between the mid‐1970s and late 1990s were due to the successive replacement of older and less fluid, by younger and more fluid, cohorts. Cohorts differed in their fluidity because the effect of class origins on educational attainment declined (an equalization effect) and because greater shares of each cohort had higher levels of educational attainment, which placed them in labor markets that operate more meritocratically (a compositional effect). The article discusses the relevance of these results for other countries and for policy."

Therefore, competent adolescents should have more stable careers and marriages, and, because they will more often be rewarded for their attributes than will less competent ones, they should experience less personality change over the adult years.

While French food retains high status, gourmet food can now come from a broad range of cuisines.

The authors take gourmet food writing as a case study to understand the rationales underlying omnivorousness. Their findings, based on qualitative and quantitative data, reveal two frames used to valorize a limited number of foods: authenticity and exoticism. These frames resolve a tension between an inclusionary ideology of democratic cultural consumption on the one hand, and an exclusionary ideology of taste and distinction on the other. This article advances our understanding of how cultural consumption sustains status distinctions in the face of eroding boundaries between highbrow and lowbrow culture."

These two strategies are evaluated and constrasted in terms of their usefulness in answering basic research questions that arise in multivariate analysis. One overriding conclusion is that, contrary to the claims of its proponents, the ordinal strategy is no better than the parametric strategy at meeting some of the basic requirements of multivariate analysis. It is argued that parametric strategy, when accompanied by careful evaluation of the validity of the implict quantification of ordinal variables, is more amenable to one of the goals of scientific research: successive approximation and refinement."

The descriptive analyses generally corroborate portraits that have recently been provided by neo-Marxists of how and where technical and bureaucratic controls evolved.

It examines the role of three key constituencies in shaping modern system of work force control: labor unions, personnel professionals, and the state. In particular, the analyses underscore the large role of government intervention in manpower activities during World War II in bureaucratizing employment. This effect of the state blurs the distinction between ""efficiency"" and ""control"" explanations of bureaucratic controls and internal labor markets, calling attention to institutional sources of change in organizations' employment structures.

Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, which includes a subsample of twins, this study evaluates the relationship between happiness and various features of success before and after eliminating the influence of endowments. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Yet the results also suggest that the role of genetic endowments varies considerably across different features of success, suggesting complex patterns of selection, reinforcement, and causation among genes and the environment."

The basic form of the latent-trait model can be modified to include parameters pertaining to association of the observed indicators. This modification is especially appropriate when the two variables arise from parallel observations on the memebers of dyads rather than from observations on two distict items (attitudes, actions) pertaining to individual respondent. Limitations of the illustrative analyses reported here are, for the most part, intrinsic to the 16-fold table itself, whatever the analytical strategy, or are shared with other forms of survey analysis. The latent-trait approach, however, may make such limitations easier to see."

The comparative interest focused on two features: (1) the presumed sharper discontinuity of French class structure compared with the more diffuse American system; and (2) the supposed differences in mobility attitudes in the two countries. Structure and attitudes are commonly taken as conditioners of the mobility experience, moderating or heightening its hypothesized effects on (for example) feelings of social isolation, ethnic prejudice, sense of relative deprivation, and political radicalism or conservatism. The analysis, however, argues strongly in support of French-American similarity rather than difference, in two major respects: (1) mobility attitudes showed the same basic structure and correlation pattern; and (2) as expected, the effects which can be attributed to objective mobility were highly limited in both countries."

We also suggest strategic advantages of individual event data over the aggregate analyses which dominate empirical studies of these issues. Our results indicate that work stoppages are more likely to become violent when they are large in size and long in duration and occur over multiple issues; some of our negative findings on other issue dimensions challege long-standing assumptions in conflict theory. We then analyze the relationship between violence and strike outcomes and find that, net of other determinants, violent strikes are less likely to end in success for workers."

The central phenomenon examined is the legal differentiation of adults and children through the creation of unique deviant statuses for children and the denial of procedural rights as a requirement for their incarceation. A variant of legal evolution theory, based on a model suggested by Turner, is used to explore the determinants of legal differentiation in this case. Documentary sources and quantitative data from state juvenile codes and census records are used to show, first, that the establishment of juvenile reformatories was a necessary precondition for changes in the legal status of children and, second, that the diffusion of reformatories is explainable, not by modernization in general but rather by a combination of semi-independent socioecomonic, cultural, and political factors."

These phenomena are characterized by a power‐law distribution of event sizes. This kind of analysis is applied to outbreaks of class conflict in Chicago from 1881 to 1886. Events are defined as individual strikes or miniature strike waves; size is measured by the number of establishments or workers involved. In each case, events follow a power law spanning two or three orders of magnitude. A similar pattern is found for strikes in Paris from 1890 to 1899. The “forest fire” model serves to illustrate the kind of process that can generate this distribution."

Several writers have argued that authoritarianism results, at least in part, from the lack of broad social perspectives. However, they have not made it sufficiently clear how breadth of perspective operates to discourage authoritarianism and how it relates to more than one or two of the several components of the authoritarianism complex. By specifically taking account of the particular world view which underlies the interdependent characteristics of authoritarianism, it is possible to explicate the relationship between breadth of perspective and authoritarianism. This world view seems impressively similar to the concept of ""reification,"" as described explicitly or implicitly by a number of social theorists. It is maintained here that reification is induced by narrow perspectives and diminished by broadened perspectives. An ""authoritarian personality"" is not a prerequisite for such reification. But many of the characteristics of authoritarianism can result from this orientation toward social reality."

Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within economic sociology."

The author reviews the past treatment of ""action"" in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an empirically grounded account. The account of ""confirming allusions"" is offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of repetition in talk-in-interaction. In conclusion, the significance of both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture and for sociological theory is discussed."

The attempt to put war into a biological category errs not so much from a failure to distinguish between social and biological aspects of war as from failure to distinguish between competition and conflict as different aspects of the ""struggle for existence."" Competition may be regarded as an individuating or analytic process; conflict as an integrating process. Wars have provided the necessity for an organization of society which, for the purpose of collective action at least, has become immeasurably superior to the primitive horde. The state not only had its origin in war, but its chief function continues to be preparation for and execution of war. Where no common interests or ""constitutional understandings"" exist to make compromise possible, wars seem inevitable. Ideological wars turn out to be struggles for land because political control and sovereignty of territory are necessary to maintain the different ways of life represented by the parties to these conflicts. The function of war has been (I) to extend the area of peace, (2) to create within that area a political power capable of enforcing it, and (3) to establish an ideology which rationalizes and a cult which idealizes the new political and social order."

Teachers were most likely to act in accord with their predisposition when they received social support from colleagues and were not under cross-pressure.Four different types of cross-pressure led teachers to avoid making a clear decision. Teachers who supported the union but feared sanctions were less likely to picket than those who did not fear sanctions. The social-psychological and structural determinants of fear are examined. Teachers who were negatively predisposed toward the strike but had colleagues as a salient reference group were less likely to cross the picket line than those who did not have colleagues as a reference group.

This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France."

Thanks to common foundations in both epistemology and ontology, these two fields can benefit from drawing more explicitly on each other. The process‐theoretic tradition in social theory and contemporary agent‐based models shift theorizing from nomothetic to generative explanations of social forms, and from variable‐based to configurative ontologies.

Although recent developments in human ecology have emphasized the adaptation of cummunities to external contingencies, this internal emphasis has continued to dominate the criminological literature. This paper examines the effects of radical change in adjoining areas on local delinquency rates. Evidence is presented that such external processes have a significant effect on local rates of delinquency. The consideration of these processes may explain why some stable, organized communities are nevertheless characterized by high rates of delinquency. Suttle's concept of the defended community provides a promising means of incorporating these findings into general ecological models of crime and delinquency."

No such transition occurred, however. Previous explanations for this are inadequate, because they discount the strength of the Tuscany economy or downplay the presence of these preconditions. To explain the Tuscan outcome, this article draws on sectoral theories (agriculture vs. manufacturing) from the neoclassical and Marxist literature. Since these theories often give the wrong prediction, because they are based on formal attributes of actors, the author combines them with a Weberian conceptualization of substantively specific economic interests."

This raises serious questions concerning the validity of the A-scale and concerning the interpretation of the F-scale. This study serves as yet another reminder that the research interview invariably creates a social relationship with consequences of importance forthe interpretation of data."

The approach is applied to the aggregate change of mind by the U.S. Senate as it moved from support of the Vietnam war to opposition from 1964 to 1973. Substantively, cumulative war costs, public opinion, and antiwar demonstrations all had significant effects on Senate roll call outcomes, but they were so highly intercorrelated that their separate effects could not be disentangled. In addition, demonstrations taking place in the months before a vote had a slight positive impact on the number of dovish votes received by motions. The 1970 invasion of Cambodia seems to have led to a significant turning point in the way the Senate dealt with the war. The general strengths and weaknesses of the new approach are assessed. It opens a new area to statistical inquiry and generates a number of novel questions that should lead to additional research."

Using newly available data, this analysis classifies homicide into two types, primary and nonprimary, based on the victim/offender relationship. Two models that have appeared in the literature are replicated, utilizing this classificatory scheme. State primary-homicide rates are found to be related to poverty and to the percentage of the population aged 20-34, while nonprimary homicide rates are significantly related only to the percentage of the state living in urban areas. Replication of the original models demonstrates that the failure to classify homicides in this manner results in the incorrect assessment of the relative size and importance of the various predictors of homicide included in these models."

The presumed opposition between authority and markets is not supported by league histories in the four major team sports. These histories show that, contrary to expectations, market potential has the greatest influence on winning when league authority is formally strongest. Market potential has no influence on performance when league authority is opposed by antitrust law, player unions, rival leagues, or league members. To explain this anomaly, authority and market relations must both be seen as embedded within the multiplex relations among team owners. These relations changed dramatically with the rise of national audiences in the past three decades. Inequality among equals replaced inequality among unequals as the support of a rootless national audience replaced rooted and unequal local audiences, altering the opportunity context of owners."

In the adjustment of the personality and of the emotional life of the pupils which resulted, came increased facility in academic skills and increased mental activifty.

Economics was crucial to the creation of financial derivatives exchanges: it helped remedy the drastic loss of legitimacy suffered by derivatives in the first half of the 20th century. Option pricing theory—a “crown jewel” of neoclassical economics—succeeded empirically not because it discovered preexisting price patterns but because markets changed in ways that made its assumptions more accurate and because the theory was used in arbitrage. The performativity of economics, however, has limits, and an emphasis on it needs to be combined with classic themes in economic sociology, such as Granovetterian embedding and the way in which exchanges can be cultures and moral communities in which collective action problems can be solved."

This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic‐commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics."

Sociology is trying to be science, not philosophy; or if it is ultimately to merge into a realistic philosophy, it will not be aphilosophy of the dialectical type.

Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure."

The model consist of two groups who are maximally heterogeneous on the crystallization dimension of attitudes. The class of ""true attitude"" holders provides an identical response at each time period with certainty; the over-time responses of the class of ""nonattitude"" holders are statistically independent. Previous research employing this model with three-wave panel data has considered all respondents who provided even one ""no opinion"" or equivocal response as nonopinion holders and combined this group with the estimated nonattitudes under the model. This results in very high levels of nonattitudes. In this research, an argument is developed for treating the nonsubstantive responses probabilitstically. When the tabulations analyzed include an equivocal response category, the simple black-and-white model no longer fits. An alternative black-gray-white model is proposed that fits the data well. Estimates of nonattitudes under this model are markedly lower than under the black-and-white model."

The analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime control politics and policies at the national level that reflected historical traditions found in Sun Belt states."

A literature review is presented that points to a number of shortcomings in existing studies, most of which are associated with the psychological reductionism that predominates in this area of study. An effort is made to provide a sociological account of voluntary risk taking by (1) introducing a new classifyin concept- edgework-based on numerous themes emerging from primary and secondary data on risk taking and (2) explaining edgework in terms of the newly emerging social psychological perspective produced from the synthesis of the Marxian and Meadian frameworks. The concept of edgework highlights the most sociologically relevant features of voluntary risk taking, while the connections between various aspects of risk-taking behaviour and structural characteristic of modern American society at both the micro and macro levels.

The more profound effects of the war upon the family include intensification of the trend roward the companionship type of family; a further rise in the status of women; further losses of family function, with the increasing use of nursery schools for the rearing of preschool-age children and the extension of governmental provision for family security; further liberalization of the code of sexual morality; and an increase in family instability as an accompaniment of the transition from the institutional to the companionship type of family."

It is, on the other hand, expressive and personal like music. Both forms of communication function in bringing about those understandings between individuals and peoples which are the substance-the warp and woof-of culture. The social function of communication seems to be to bring about and maintain understanding and cultural solidarity among individuals and societies. It may be contrasted with the social function of competition which is to bring about an orderly distribution and a division of labor between individuals and societies. This division of labor, so far as it is brought about by competition, involves the individuation of the competing units. Competition and communication may thus be said to suplement each other, since communication operates as an integrating and socializing principle, while competition is the principles of individuation. More specifically, communication may be said to operate in two dimensions. On the one hand, it serves to bring about a diffusion of cultural traits and so widen the cultural area within which socia relations may exist. On the other hand, communication, in so far as it brings diverse cultural influences into focus at some center of communication, like the rural village or metropolitan city, tends the bring into the common understanding new ideas-ideas that inevitably arise in the ferment, confusion, and conflict of the acculturation process. The processes of diffusion and acculturation seem to take place in the manner and under the conditions in which news is collected and diffused. It is characteristic of news that it circulates as far as its message is understood and seems important. It is probable, however, that the cinema, which circulates not news, but pictures, is more devastating in its effects upon local cultures and in bringing the widely dispersed people of the world within the influence of a single culture of civilization than is the news proper."

However, hypotheses concerning the relationship between family compliance structures and school compliance structures, parental attachment, association with delinquent friends, and self-reported delinquent behavior are generally supported. Few differences are observed in separate analyses for males and females. Although the results raise questions about Colvin and Pauly's emphasis on a reconceptualized construct of social class, their incorporation of family and school compliance structures in their causal model is a promising contribution to the development of integrated theories of delinquency."

The nature of this paradox, its origins, and the means of transcending it are illustrated primarily through an analysis of Marx's theory of metabolic rift, which, it is contended, offers important classical foundations for environmental sociology."

Models of institutional influence and of within-school processes are developed for both secondary and postsecondary education to integrate and refine the literatures on school effects and returns to schooling. Rather impressive occupational status and earnings differentials are associated with gross school-to-school differences and with qualitative differences in educational experiences within institutions. Secondary school characteristics and experiences weigh particularly upon the market outcomes of youth who terminated formal schooling at high school graduation. We suggest that the traditional use for quantitative indices of schooling (years of school completed or certification levels) in assessing the market consequences of investments in education needs to be supplemented by information on qualitative variations in educational experiences. Additionally, the likelihood that school experiences may have quite different implications for selected target populations deserves further consideration. The simplistic assumption implicit in much of the school-effects literature that institutional effects are homogeneous may actually mask quite important consequences for certain students."

In particular, we examine the post-World War II political-economic experience of the United States, because the military expenditures thesis was most fully developed initially in an attempt to explain postwar American prosperity. We evaluate what we term the ""naive"" model of Baran and Sweezy, which suggests that the degree to which national output is absorbed by military spending should be dependent on aggregate economic conditions such as unemployment. Finding only inconsistent evidence to support the naive view, we incorporate the insights of recent neo-Marxists (especially O'Connor) on the linkages among the monopoly corporate sector, the unionized sector of labor, and the state. The empirical evidence appears consistent with this ""modified"" view, with unemployment in the unionized sector and rate of growth of monopoly profits significantly affecting variation in military expenditures as a percentage of GNP during the postwar period. We then introduce a variety of controls in an attempt to determine if our results are simply statistical artifacts of equation specification, of time dependence, of estimation procedures, or of measurement strategy. Despite a multitude of such checks, we find that our results remain statistically significant and in the predicted direction. We do find, however, that additional economic (i.e., concentration) and political (i.e., the electoral cycle) variables also affect military spending."

But how much will future generations benefit from these gains, and will black and white Americans benefit equally? Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study examines differences in the process of educational reproduction for black and white Americans. The approach considers the implication of race and education differences in marriage, assortative mating, and fertility in the parent generation on the distribution of schooling in the next generation. The analyses use a dynamic, multidimensional model that allows for intergenerational pathways at the individual, family, and population levels. The results show that these demographic mechanisms play an important role in explaining race differences in educational reproduction. Ignoring these pathways underestimates intergenerational effects for whites and overestimates them for blacks."

This paper questions that hypothesis on both theoretical and methodological grounds by exploring (a) ambiguities in the links between patriarchy and capitalism and (b) the meanings of housework across cultural and historical settings. A research agenda is proposed in which it is suggested that housework is both an ordeal of civility through which individuals judge their joint membership in the same social milieu and an ordeal of conviviality through which individuals who pass within the same milieu reinforce social bonds. The conclusion elucidates why changes in the division of housework should not be synonymous with the eradication of tasks.

While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance."

The starting point is the interactionist theory of motivation basic to most of the social psychological research on white-collar crime. Interactionist theory helps us understand white-collar crime in terms of the offenders' symbolic construction of their social worlds but ultimately fails to explain its causes. It is argued that the origins of symbolic motivational patterns are to be found in the social structure of industrial capitalism and the ""culture of competition"" to which it gives rise. But no theory of motivation, however sophisticated, is sufficient to explaint the causes of white-collar crime, and the paper therefore concludes with an analysis of the patterns of opportunities presented to social actors in different structural positions in advanced capitalist nations."

They argue that socialism was made into a laboratory of economic knowledge during the socialist calculation debate of the 1920s and 1930s. An extensive debate during the Cold War is also documented and shows that a transnational network continued to be organized around attempts to connect the results obtained in the socialist laboratory with debates and struggles in Western economics. Finally, the drafting of transition blueprints in postcommunist Eastern Europe after 1989, with the participation of American economists, is shown to be a continuation of this transnational network."

The simultaneous application of the two sets of instruments to a small sample of manufacturing organizations uggests a certain amount of convergence, but raises serious doubts about the validity of some of the indicators. The differences in scope of the impirical referent of the indicators appear to be a major source for the lack of convergent validity."

This phenomenon, which clashes with the image of secularization, is particularly notable among the youth of the counterculture. To further sociological analysis, a conceptualization of esoteric culture is proposed. It is further argued that esoteric culture has played a significant role in Western cultural change, in such areas as artistic expressions of reality, political ideas, and even scientific thought. Esoteric culture is thus treated as a source of ideational innovations in Western modernization."

The major substantive portions of the paper are concerned with an explication of the way in which the social and historical context of Afrikaner Calvinism shaped Afrikaner operant religion and, secondly, with resulting consequences for economic action."

Through misfortune rather than fault the early American sociologists were able to satisfy this condition only in a meager degree. Consciousness of the lack of social science in general is a late achievement. Sociological consciousness is a specialized phase of the more general apprehension. The outline, to which the first section is an introduction, sketches certain methological developments, in the older divisions of social science, which proved to be antecedents of sociology. In brief, attempts to interpret human experience have advanced from mysticism to criticism, and to differentiated and specialized criticism. The exhibit which is to follow indicates certain gradations in this progress which emerged in sociology. Waymarks of the evolution of sociology are selected chiefly from German methodologists, because their influence upon the generation of American scholars who won academic recognition for the subject is more evident and cumulative than other sequences."

Each occupation maintains a sense of superior production (an ""occupational aesthetic"") that is not reducible to organizational demands. This perspective extends the production of culture approach that sees art as being like all work, suggesting, in contrast, that all work is like art. An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task."

The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics."

Analysis of the Permanent Community Sample provides strong power-policy relationships that support the major tenets of the growth machine explanation: As members of the business elite gain power, they can successfully promote population growth that provides them with greater profits through higher property values. The most widely cited common good for growth, lower unemployment, does not accrue.

In its early phase public opinion was preoccupied with domestic affairs, but during the French Revolutionary wars and after the Congress of Vienna the utilization of public opinion in international affairs, became generally respectable among statesmen.

This examination concurs with Bonacich's argument that a major form of ethnic conflict is generated in the labor market but demonstrates the necessity of specifying the historical period of capitalist development in which the victory of higher-priced workers, through the formation of a split labor market, is made possible. Such success is dependent on their degree of influence on the state, which, in turn, depends on their location in the productive process and on their level of economic and political organization."

Refutations proposed in the Becker critique of the specific instance of Pietism and science strengthen rather than weaken the grounds for deepened interest in exploring both the generic and specific hypothesese insofar as the critique exhibits the fallacy of the latest word. That fallacy rests on three common but untenable tacit assumptions: (1) that latest word correctly formulates the essentials of the preceding word while being immune to the failures of observation and inference imputed to what went before, (2) that each succeeding work improves on its knowledge base, and (3) that theoretically derived hypotheses are to be abandoned as soon as they seem to be empirically falsified.

The weighting of and relations among these various factors is still to be determined, but it appears clear that no single, simple explanation will suffice.

Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this gypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations paper received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards, did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-ranking scientists. However, lesser quality papers by high-ranking scientists receive greater attention than papers of equal quality by low-ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who to on the greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries."

A study based on hotel directories-a type of source obviously incomplete in its enumeration of hotels-indicates a larger relative number of hotel rooms in leading cities of the Pacific Coast than in the other large cities of the country. Since no definite statistical information is available for the hotel population in general, a special study was made of hotel dwellers in Seattle. This study gave the percentage of occupancy, the weekly and seasonal enables, and the sex and age composition of the population in 437 hotels. There were two and one-half times as many couples without children as couples with children. Characteristics of hotel life.-In the large metropolitan hotel the guest is only a number and is characteristically detached from the place in which he sleeps. In some cases this anonymity and impersonality encourages a restless, lonesome, unhappy state of mind. In other cases it enables an escape from the restraints of more intimate groups, such as the small town or the ghetto. Personality patterns in the hotel environment.-Although a certain formal etiquette-a kind ofmechanical correctness-tends to develop in the better class hotels, the ""mores,""that part of our tradition that is thought to involve the general welfare, tend to break down in the hotel environment. Among the heavy offenders for stealing hotel property are listed ""men and women who in their own communities command respect, but who, on going to a hotel, take a 'moral holiday.'"" The individual who lives continually in hotels tends to become either blase or urbane. The hotel child, for example, is usually overstimulated. The tendency, however, seems to be toward the development of immunity to the influences of the hotel environment, and this accommodation is best described as sophistication or urbanity. Thus the individual may gradually accustom himself to ""living in public, eating in public, and all but sleeping in public."""

Further, three spatial structures influence interlocking: the location of a corporation's headquarters vis‐a`‐vis other corporate headquarters and upper‐class clubs, the territorial distribution of a firm's production facilities, and the spatial configuration of a corporation's ownership relations.

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage."

Orchestral repertoires of the leading symphony societies were analyzed from the date of founding to the present. Various statistical measures are here applied to selected segments of this history to illustrate the degree of consensus and difference of taste between cities; the weight of conductors and political events in the formation of taste; the lag in taste between the élite and the popular audiences. Aesthetic taste, here treated empirically, not subjectively, is a complex phenomenon to which nonaesthetic factors make a large contribution."

Taylor,American Journal of Sociology,89,2,1983-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 373-401,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Latent class analysis is used to examine Philip Converse's propositions about political opinion and nonopinion in the American public. Data were taken from the 1956, 1958, 1960 and the 1972, 1974, 1976 American voter panel studies conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Results support Converse's black-and-white model of attitude stability which posits the existence of some stable opinion holders and a group of ""nonopinion"" respondents whose positions vary unpredictably over time. Rates of opinion holding in the population were estimated to range from a low of 19% for the utilities and housing item, which was Converse's focus, to an atypical high of 59% for the busing item in the second panel. Models allowing for true score change estimated that the number of true score changers was small. The nonopinion respondents were apparently responsive enough to item content that their aggregated responses reflected the climate of opinion among those whose attitudes were better crystallized. As Converse had concluded, there was relatively little overlap of ""issue publics""-those who held opinions on one issue were not necessarily opinion holders on other questions. There were not consistent differences in education or political involvement between opinion holders and nonopinion respondents. Relationships of education and political involvement to opinion holding suggest that respondents hold stable opinions on those issues that have greatest personal relevance for them."

Although these theories stem from very different intellectual traditions, their general assumption has been that widespread informal economic activities are primarily a feature of Third World economies, in which they function as a refuge from destitution; such activities are presumably destined to desappear with the advance of modern, industry-led growth. Evidence is presented that indicates that these assumptions, including the identification of informality with conditions in the less developed countries, are wrong. Alternative interpretations of the resilience of these activities in Third World countries, despite rapid industrialization, and their continuity and apparent revival in the advanced economies and discussed."

This article examines consensus, both in general and on various subjects, within and between important social groups at the beginning of the French Revolution 1789. On agenda, the subjects that a group chooses to discuss, there is evidence of national consensus. On program, the proposals of each group for action, the nobility and the Third Estate show significantly greater local than national consensus. The evidence also suggests that the country people, unlike the more elite groups, did not participate in national consensuscreating dialogue. Not surprisingly, the Thrid Estate's coming political triumph is anticipated by a higher level of Coherence than is shown by the nobility, but the difference is not nearly as great as one might expect."

Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of “fiscal inquisition” weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th‐century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy."

The peasants farm the gentry's land and their rents support the gentry in leisure. The function of the gentry is local administration. Since the rigors of government may always be mitigated by friendship, every peasant family hopes to educate a son into the gentry and official life and thus secure for itself a friend at court. The gentry, being educated, are the logical carriers of Western cultural innovation; but they are noncommercial and see no gain in Westernization. The innovators, in reality, are social outcasts who have lost their traditional status and lead a socially irresponsible life in the treaty ports. This class of compradors is a new element, usurping what would have been the gentry's role in acculturation."

Roth,American Journal of Sociology,77,5,1972-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 839-856,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"One important aspect of the control of behavior of patients and visitors on a hospital emergency service is the moral evaluation of the clients made by the staff. Such evaluation arises from the application of concepts of social worth common in the larger society and from staff concepts of appropriate work role. The process, however, is not a simple cause-effect matter, but the product of a reciprocal relationship between the attributes of the client and the categories of the staff. Emergency-department staff, like other service occupations, attempt to establish mechanisms of control over inappropriate demands for service."

Efforts to formulate general theories of society devoid of historical limitation have created serious problems for theoretical work. This article examines two important examples of this tendency: Parson's and Schutz's use of Weberian sociology to derive general theories of social action. A historically grounded procedure for generating concepts was central to Weber's work. It united explanatory and interpretative analysis within a reflexive framework that responded to the intellectual and political interests of the theorist. Early writings of Parsons and Schutz surmount, in different ways, Weber's strictures on the limits of general theory by eliminating the historical component of Weber's thought. This development reversed Weber's theoretical achievement, decomposing his synthesis into hostile theories based on key fragments of his analysis."

Most investigatiors concerned with response bias appear to believe that these response bias variables act as a form of systematic bias which significantly distorts the relationship observed between an independent and a dependent variable. However, while the literature indicates such a distortion may occur, this has not been demonstrated. Drawing on the data from a national survey, we look at the effect of these three forms of response bias on the pattern of relationships among seven demographic variables (sex, race, education, income, age, marital status, and occupation) and three very different indicators of mental health (psychiatric symptons, self-esteem, and feelings of positive affect). The results lead to an almost unequivocal conclusion: the response bias variables have very little impact on the relationship, and it seems safe to conclude that these sources of response bias do not act in a systematic way to invalidate the pattern of observed relationships between mental health and common demographic variables."

Gurevitch,American Journal of Sociology,93,5,1988-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 1179-1199,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The central assumption of phenomenological and related approaches holds that the possibility of mutual understanding and communication in interpersonal relations in contingent on the supposition of the sameness of self and other. Under this assumption, the otherness of the other is conceived as an obstacle to achieving mutual understanding. Thus, the categories of stranger and strangeness are not considered constitutive of interpersonal communication and, consequently, are analyzed either in terms of social role or as a methodological device. The present paper examines this assumption by focusing on the process of ""making the other strange,"" which involves the disengagement of the other's presence from his or her familiar, taken-for-granted identity. The other is thereby rendered. ""other,"" that is, opaque and irreducible in his individuality. This suspension of the taken-for-granted understanding opens up the possibility of a creative and critical search to understand the other and allows distinguishing among selves. Without this possibility, the picture of interpersonal communication remains incomplete. The discussion of the principles underlying this process and of its implications for an analytical account of interaction is followed by examples from everyday occurences of making strange."

The society of the East is stratified in terms of belief and disbelief rather than in terms of race or of class. The family rather than the territory is the nucleus of organization, and hence religion and nationality are inextricably interwined.

Changes in distributions of power can close some avenues of ideological autonomy and open others; thus actors will have varying degrees of control over different issues within a given ideology. In response to the rise of liberal states in 19th-century Europe, the papacy was forced to avoid sociopolitical issues if it was to avoid persistent church-state conflict. Gradually reformulating Catholic ideology within the limited structural autonomy they had, popes subordinated sociopolitical issues to more purely religious and moral issues while constructing a new ideological opposition to liberalism."
