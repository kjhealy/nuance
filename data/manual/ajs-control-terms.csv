Patterns of age at marriage and mate selection among Jewish population groups of Middle Eastern (Oriental) origin are contrasted with those of the Moslem Arab population. The institutionalization of fertility control and declining fertility among the Oriental Jewish couples marrying in Israel is contrasted with sustained high fertility of Moslem Arab couples. The relationship between change in matchmaking and amrriage patterns and change in matchmaking and marriage patterns is explored, and three conditions under which young couples beome independent decision-making units and try to control fertility are hypothesized."

Rural Ladinos of midwestern Guatemala are, with respect to education, intermediate between tribal and urban society. Schools exist, but they have little importance. On the other hand, ceremony and myth do not play a large par in the transfer of tradition. The attention of the investigator is therefore drawn to the more elementary and universal aspects of education: the informal day-to-day situations in which tradition is communicated or modified. Such a situation is analyzed, and the educational importance of these occurrences remarked, in this Guatemalan society where schools represent regulation largely external to the culture and where important traditional ceremonials are lacking."

Although attention is paid to the relative validity of different approaches to empirical investigation, constant attempts are made to freeze sociological framework into a permanent mold. Terminology is standardized rather than evaluated for its own utility. Different theories compete for all-purpose acceptance. Rationalization for the commitment to fixed theoretical structures may be seen in the increasing bureaucratization of sociological research, which cannot tolerate theoretical uncertainties."

Participation in solidary groups has consequences for the social bases of politics, and the political salience of such groups is affected by social institutions that are independent of occupational structure. The first such institution is direct rule. Whereas indirect rule tends to promote class politics, direct rule favors cultural politics. Rapid expansion of direct rule since the 1960s has muted class politics and increased cultural politics. This relationship is not deterministic, however; other institutions can mitigate the effects of direct rule on the social bases of politics."

Much of this work has a psychological orientation. There are differences in emphasis between the relationalistic (strategic) and the non-rationalistic approaches. Schelling has transformed classic game theory into a theory of interaction. Rapoport rejects the game approach as leading to absurd results. Richardson's collective-behavior model is espoused by both Rapoport and Boulding, but it is used differently by them. The bureaucratization of violence has been commented on by Hannah Arendt. The theory of non-violence has not been cultivated; but Schelling's concept of the co-ordination game may prove useful. Sociological research tends to be empirical rather than theoretical, but it now applies more sophisticated techniques than in the past. Experimental studies, based on laboratory ""games"" and simulation studies, combine theoretical and empirical approaches. Some of these games are as useful as projective tests as they are as techniques for studying conflict."

These studies are empirically deficient because single measurement of cohesiveness of the same groups are not positively and highly correlated. A unitary concept of cohesiveness is unacceptable because of the incorrect assumption that different aspect of cohesiveness are highly correlated. Additional limitations are lack of concern for the importance of the negative case in scientific investigations and overgeneralization. Alternative operational and conceptual definitions are suggested.

This paper describes a design in which intergenerational mobility is studies from two perspectives. In the conventional approach sons report on their own statuses and give proxy reports for parental statuses. In our second perspective parents are questioned about themselves and give proxy information on their children. Estimates of a five-variable status-attainment model for eachperspective yield similar results, but some correlations and regressions differ significantly because nonrandom errors influence the reporting of socioeconomic data among adults. Our anomalous findings suggest that mobility researchers might consider employing both questioning strategies as a guide to potential biases until a definitive test shows that the caution prescribed in this paper is unwarranted. Consumers of mobility studies are entitled to reserve judgment on data that depend entirely on the traditional approach even though current research adheres to it almost without exception."

Such an elite is seen to profit through the increasing intensification of the land use of the area in which its members hold a common interest. An elite competes with other land-based elites in an effort to have growth-inducing resources invested within its own area as opposed to that of another. Governmental authority, at the local and nonlocal levels, is utilized to assist in achieving this growth at the expense of competing localities. Conditions of community life are largely a consequence of the social, econimic, and political forces embodied in this growth machine. The relevance of growth to the interests of various social groups is examined in this context, particularly with reference to the issue of unemployment. Recent social trends in opposition to growth are described and their potential consequences evaluated."

Almost universally, the individual German projects responsibility upon the Nazi party or the S.S.

What is needed to sustain morale is a body of industrial folkways. The modern factory is not a society. Industrial fatigue and lack of morale are due to some interference or failure to preserve the organic and social balance. What is true with regard to industry applies also to industrial civilization generally. Increasing mobility and industrial expansion have broken up the traditional order and have not permitted the establishing of a new one. The ills of modern industrial civilization are cultural, not political, and are incident to the existing industrial regime."

New-class theorists have depicted these ""knowledge workers"" as engaged in a contest for power and status with traditionally powerful business elites. However, the liberal attitudes of knowledge workers may also be interpreted as the result of a conjunction of several general trends in American society that have had little to do with class antagonisms. According to this paper, even though left-of-center attitudes are not uncommon in the salaried professional categories, these attitudes tend to be more ferormist than antibusiness in character. Such dissent as exists is concentrated in particular occupational, cohort, and sectoral categories and has varied considerably over time. Only the younger specialists in social science and arts-related occupations beging to fit the image of an ""oppositional intelligentsia"" used by the theorists to characterize the new class at large. The data are more consistent with cumulative-trend explanations of upper-white-collar liberalism and dissent. Nevertheless, the consistent net association of the key new-class category, the higher levels of education, with political liberalism leaves room for continued thinking about political cultural conflic within a new-class framework."

Marsden AND Joseph Galaskiewicz,American Journal of Sociology,83,3,1977-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 594-631,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The conception of community leadership structure as a regularized pattern of communication and exchange of information pertinent to community affairs among members of a community elite, proposed by Laumann and Pappi (1973-1976), is extended in several related direcions. First, the network of regularized communication contact is related to issue-specific discussion patterns and to outcome preference and activation on specific issues. Our anlysis indicates that our measure of the routinized community-affairs discussion network is valid in that it represents a distillation of contact patterns that exist with regard to a variety of specific issues. Moreover, discussion contacts among the elite on routine, instrumental issues are found to be more closely reflected in the regularized network than are such contacts on unique, value-laden consummatory issues. We also find a moderated degree of ""institutionalization"" of contact patterns and support for an instrumentally orientad ""bargaining"" model of issue resolution in two American communities. Cross-community variations in bases of communication contact discussed in the latter part of the paper suggest that such a model may be associated with the use of business/professional ties in an influence structure, while an ""oppositional"" model may be characteristics of communities in which contact patterns are rooted in informal social relations."

Micro-evidence and theoretical critiques indicate that human cognitive capacity is limited. Hence actor facing complex contingencies rely largely upon tacit assumptions and routine. The routines of physical property and organizational authority are upheld by actors' tacit monitoring of social coalitions. Individuals continuously negotiate such coalitions in chains of interaction rituals in which conversations create symbols of group membership. Every encounter is a marketpace in which individuals tacitly match conversational and emotional resources acquire from previous encounters. Individuals are motivated to move toward those ritual encounters in which their microresources pay the greatest emotional returns until they reach personal equilibrium points at which their emotional returns stabilize or decline. Large-scale changes in social structure are produced by aggregate changes in the three types of microresources: increases in generalized culture due to new communications media or specialized culture-producing activities; new ""techologies"" of emotional production; and new particularized cultures (individual reputations) due to dramatic, usually conflictual, events. A method of macrosampling the distribution of microresources is proposed."

Accordinlgy, recent interest in measuring social conditions and in building models of how various social forces determine changes in social conditions was predated by work of William F. Ogburn and his collaborators over 50 years ago. In this paper, we argue for a revival of analyses of social change based upon time series of indices of social conditions. To provide a general paradigm for this type of analysis, we describe (1) an opportunity-structures theoretical framework for generating specifications of equations of dynamic macro social indicator models, (2) a demographic accounting framework for grounding such equations in population stocks and flows, and (3) a structural equation strategy for estimating and evaluating the resulting models. To illustrate this paradigm, we present analyses of three equation determining changes in the national reported property crime rate, the reported violent crime rate, and the rate of public police expenditures. The equations fit annual 1947-72 time-series data well, yield theoretically meaningful coefficients, and lack demonstrable autocorrelation of disturbances. Moreover, the conditional forecasts of the 1973 values of the reported crime rates fall well within bounds set by the standard errors of the equations."

It argues that join legal custody encourages similarities between the way divorced fathers and fathers in two-parent households invest in their children. The analysis used data from a representative sample of recent divorces, in which children live with their mothers, to explore the relationship between legal custody and legal child-support obligations (awards) and to investigate the effects of the type of custody on child-support payments. Joint legal custody is associated with higher support awards, but the association is explained by the higher incomes of fathers with joint custody. Legal custody arrangements do not affect levels of child-support payments when family characteristics and the amont of child support awarded at divorce are taken into account. Legal custody does,however, alter the process governing fathers' contributions to child support. Parents' incomes have a larger effect, and child-supprt awards a smaller one, on payments among families with joint legal custody, suggesting that joint legal custody may allow fathers greater discretion about contributions to child support. By stengthening ties between divorced fathers and children, join legal custody may increase the correspondence between parents' and children's socioeconomic status and result in greater inequality among children of divorce."

Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women’s underinvestment in firm‐specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm‐specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high‐skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women’s disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand‐side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in nonformalized labor markets are discussed."

The authors explore its causes using data on the distribution of family income in 3,098 U.S. counties in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The authors build a model of within‐county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multilevel methods are used to distinguish county cross‐sectional, state cross‐sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state‐level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross‐sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross‐sectionally."

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change."

Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non‐NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized.

Exposure to the broadcast is in to way controlled or stimulated, and the effect as measured tends to be independent of experimental influences.

Quantitative cross‐national data on a more recent wave of democratizations, from 1989 to 1996, confirm these findings. Models using direct maximum‐likelihood estimation find that the ratio of adults with higher education has a significant positive effect on change in democracy levels, as measured by two longitudinal scales (Polity IV and Polyarchy).

The history of accounting methods and practices from the Middle Ages to the 19th century is surveyed in order to evaluate these arguments. Two important dimensions of accounting are discussed: the rhetorical and the technical. The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures. Goody's analysis of writing and literacy is applied to the development of accounting as a technique. As a practical method, double-entry bookkeeping appears to have increased ""rationality,"" but the rhetorical side of double entry is also critical. The conclusion is that the significance of double-entry bookkeeping can be appreciated only if its rhetorical and technical aspects are considered."

By a series of comparisons of textile industries in 19th-century England, United States, and Russia, the article highlights four factors that shape factory regimes: the labor process, market forces, the reproduction of labor power, and the state. It shows how an examination of factory regimes can account for the absorption of working-class radicalism in England after 1850 and the deepening of working-class radicalism in Russia after 1905, culminating in the revolution-ary movements of 1917.

Stable interaction between client and professional is most likely when internalized norms, common expectations, and optimum cathexis exist among the role partners. These conditions are best met by the physician-patient pair, less well met by ministers and counselees, and least of all by psychotherapists and patients. Social proximity and distance each have advantages and disadvantages in maintaining the conditions of stable interaction. Mechanisms which bridge the social distance gap yet keep professionals from too high an involvement with clients are described.

The likelihood that the probation officers will submit more cases from minority groups than from Anglos for formal court hearings is reduced below levels of statiscal signigicance when appropriate considerations are taken into account-except for those for whom extensive handling seems most logical. The likelihood that the judge will send more minority-group members than Anglos to the youth authority, however, persists for most categories of offenders even when these considerations are taken into account. The biases appear to consist largely of letting Anglos ""get off easy"" rather than of requiring uncalled-for ""treatment"" for minority-group members.

In event‐history analyses of data from 279 organizations, this research finds that these legal changes stimulated organizations to create personnel, antidiscrimination, safety, and benefits departments to manage compliance. Yet as institutionalization proceeded, middle managers came to disassociate these new offices from policy and to justify them in purely economic terms, as part of the new human resources management paradigm. This pattern is typical in the United States, where the Constitution symbolizes government rule of industry as illegitimate.

Semiotic and linguistic theory is used to expose essential properties associated with the successful communication of meaning in each context. The authors find that e‐mail requires the cultivation of new techniques for specifically conveying the “pragmatic information” that connects the meaning of words to their users. Such information is assigned in e‐mail through the use of what are termed emphatic, referential, and characterizing semiotic tactics. These tactics are also evident in sustained online interactions studied by other researchers.

Quantitative analyses of individual and job-level data in a state government pay system indicate that the administered efficiency model does not adequately explain malefemale earnings differences. Documentary, testimonial, and interview data strongly suggest the significance of bureaucratic politics in the pay-determination process. We conclude that market forces influence wage rates but are heavily mediated by organizational factors unrelated to efficiency considerations in the type of organization studied here."

Any satisfactory theory must attempt to account for the fact that the repeated administration of opiates sometimes is followed by addition and sometimes is not. The factor which accounts for this differential effect appears to be the person's knowledge or belief, supplied him by his cultural milieu, concerning the nature of the distress that accompanies the sudden cessation of the opiate. If he fails to realize the connection between this distress and the opiate he escapes addiction, whereas if he attributes the discomfort to the opiate and thereafter uses the opiate to alleviate it he invariably becomes addicted. Addiction is generated in the process of using the drug consciously to alleviate withdrawal distress. No exceptions to this theory could be found. It is confirmed by analysis of certain aspects of addict argot and by the consideration of certain types of crucial cases. The theory provides a simple means of accounting for many aspects of the habit. It is methodologically significant in that it is based upon case data and is at the same time universal in form and subject to definite verification or disproof."

The most impressive empirical documentation of this link at the aggregate level has come from time-series analyses. Studies at the individual level have begun to specify the causal elements in such relations, with emphasis on the variable health outcomes of economic deprivation. Specifying the duration of effect, however, requires longitudinal data. Such studies are still rare in the field and most are too limited in time span to test duration hypotheses. Using one of the oldest known achieves of longitudinal data, this study examines the consequences of the Great Depression experiences of middle-and working-class women for their well-being in old age, 40 years later. Adaptations to human and material loss in the 1930s varied widely by social class, reflecting the greater severity of economic stress and the greater resource disadvantage of working-class families. With health measurements before the Depression and some 40 years later, the results show consistently adverse effects of economic loss for working-class women and benign outcomes among women of higher status. These long-term implications of decremental change point to the need for greater understanding of the life course in studies of the interplay of social history and life history."

The findings support the argument that ethnic conflict and labor unrest are parallel forms of collective action and that each depends on the number and foundings of national labor unions. The effect of labor union organization is strongest for all attacks on blacks. In addition, sharp increases in immigration, a downturn in economic fortunes, and contagion processes all raise rates of ethnic conflict."

The dynamics generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network. The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime.

A number of proposals for electoral reform have been advanced, ranging from simple alterations of the present Electoral College system to comprehensive reformations such as adopting a district plan, proportional division of the electoral vote, or direct popular election of the president. In this paper we investigate how the impact of various social groups on the outcome of a presidential contest would be altered under each of the reform proposals. A simulation methodology is used, with baseline data on group voting obtained from the 1960 contest between Kennedy and Nixon. Our results indicate that, in comparison with the popular vote, the Electoral College advantages the following population groups: large-state residents, metropolitan area residents, Negroes, Catholics, and possibly low-income persons. The district and proportional plans, by generally disadvantaging these populations relative to the popular vote, would build a reverse bias into the electoral system."

Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the globalization of bankruptcy law has proceeded through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law."

Despite common claims of cohort effects, some scholars remain skeptical because cohort effects are notoriously difficult to distinguish from age and period effects. Nineteenth Amendment women were in fact less likely to vote in the 1952-88 elections and this gender gap is unique to the amendment cohorts.

The evidence suggests that the children of mothers who married young and were pregnant at marriage entered into their own marital and nonmarital unions significantly earlier than others. The experience of parental marital dissolution increases children's nonmarital cohabitations but has little effect on their marriages. While no single causal mechanism can easily account for all of the empirical data, the combination of different attitudes toward marriage, nonmarital sex, and cohabitation can account for the empirical findings."

This paper examines the additive and interactive influence of these two groups of variables using a sample of fix time points (every five years from 1950 to 1975) for 18 relatively developed nations. Models are estimated by using generalized least squares which relate labor force participation of males aged 65 and over to such variables as the size of the agricultural labor force, the old-age dependency ratio, government revenues, social insurance and pension benefits, coverage of the population by pension systems, and the existence of means and retirement tests. The results show dominant effects from the nonpolicy variables that relate to occupational changes in industrial economies and secondary effects from policy-manipulable variables such as pension expenditures that can be changed to increase labor force participation rates and ease the strain on social security systems."

In the petrochemical industry the existence of a powerful state enterprise within the sector was critical to the state's ability to restructure the industry. What resulted was neither a ""reinvention of the bourgeoisie"" nor the creation of a ""state capitalist"" sector but, rather, an interesting oligopolistic community in which state and private local capital are thoroughly integrated and similarly organized.

In the rebound from this view it is necessary to avoid the dangers of ""sociologism"" which would disregard the true task of psychicatry which is the understanding of the fundamental and relatively invariable structure of the personality. Psychiatry will be of assistance to social analysis to the extent that it aids in revealing the intricate symbolic network which binds individuals together into collectivities."

This article analyzes 80 biology textbooks published from 1952 to 2002 to reveal that U.S. biology texts have pursued the topic of race with renewed vigor in recent years. Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks’ transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept. The texts also make clear that race is not a one‐time construct or a relic of centuries past. Instead, it is continually remade—and is being reworked today—suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification."

Further, a variety of survey studies, including a major unpublished one by Gouldner, indicate that sociologists as a group have been the most left-disposed field in academe, an occupation which is to the left of other strata. Within sociology, the ""achievers,"" those at the most prestigeous schools, who have published most, and have the most research funds, are to the left of others in the field. This pattern reflects a general characteristics of intellectual life in which the most successful people hold more unorthodox socially critical views, behavior which may stem from a link between creativity and heterodoxy.

This thesis challenges those theories which claim that the importance of class conflicts declined under state socialism and that therefore such societies should be described as containing nonantagonistic classes or strata. It also challenges the critical theories which acknowledge the existence of a new dominant class in Eastern Europe, but which describe that class as the bureaucracy or technobureaucracy. This paper attempts to base its class analysis on the exploration of the mechanisms and institutions of expropriation of surplus under state socialism. It is suggested that in contemporary Eastern Europe private ownership and market mechanisms of expropriation have been replaced by central planning and redistribution of the economic surplus. All those who have vested interests in the maximization of redistributive power are members of a new dominating class. If we define the new class this way it will include more than just the bureaucracy; potentially, it includes the whole intelligentsia. The paper describes the new dominant class of intelligentsia as a class in statu nascendi. The formation of this class takes a whole historical epoch. In the first stage of state-socialist development the Djilas thesis is basically accurate: under Stalinism and in the early post-Stalinist years the bureaucracy had the monopoly of power. During the last two decades, on the other hand, the social base of power holders has broadened, especially in those countries which experimented with economic and political reforms. The formation of a new dominant class which incorporates the whole of the intelligentsia is now under way."

Four hypotheses regarding the effect of a father's absence are tested: the ""no-effects"" hypothesis, the ""economic-deprivation"" hypothesis, the ""father-absence"" hypothesis, and the ""family-stress"" hypothesis. Separate analyses are presented for black and whites. The findings indicate that growing up in a female-headed family increases the risk of poverty, but not because of father absence per se.

In 1913, defending the ""principal ideas"" of that work, Durkheim supported his conception of the ""duality of human nature"" (simultaneously social and individual) by emphasizing the ""dynamogenic quality of religion,"" its ability to inspire human aciton a well as to curb it. These arguments do not represent a straighforward development of Durkheim's earlier work but must be undestood within the borader intellectual context within which he worked. Of particular importance were the growing differences among British social anthropologists, notably William Robertson Smith and James Frazer, concerning the mythic or utilitarian nature of primitive religion. On the evidence of this context, it is argued that one of the most critical shifts in the development of Durkheim's sociology of religion took place only after 1900. The process by which Durkheim developed his arguments in support of the former position may be understood in the light of recent work associated with the ""strong programme"" in the sociology of science. Major contemporary works used by Durkheim can be viewed as exemplars and the basis for analogies between substantively different areas of work rather than as the product of the application of a generalizable sociological method."

Primary minority groups are the result of a new relationship established between two pre-existing functioning social systems through annexation of a territory with its population or more rarely through group migration.

Contemporary concerns within the civilian sector regarding quality of work life have made it necessary for the military services to become increasingly concerned with the work-related attitudes of their personnel. Our analysis compared the attitudes of a sample of soldiers in the all-volunteer army in 1973 with those of soldiers in the conscription-based army of World War II. We found that representative samples of enlisted men in 1943 were more positively oriented toward their jobs than are the soldiers of the 1970s. Some similarities were observed between World War II AWOLs and soldiers in the all-volunteer force. The relatively negative attitudes of contemporary soldiers may reflect, at least in part, a postwar demoralization that was observed after the end of hostilities in World War II as well."

Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of “contentious” political action. Instead, to establish tribes’ status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians."

In the relationship between status and education, important departures from linearity may occur as a result of certification screening (of preference) by employers; yet many researchers have virtually ignored this process and the possibility that it may serve several functions. Data from the 1977 NORC General Social Survey show that academic certification has a substantial impact on occupational prestige and (more ambiguously) on respondent's income, independently of years of school completed and other predictors; this impact appears to vary according to age of respondent. In conclusion, the status-attainment proces in the United States may depart substantially from the ""rational choice"" model favored by human capital theory."

The problem of transmission is complicated by movements and migration of peoples and by the rapidity of social change, due to technological advances. Cultural crises arise when the tradition transmitted, including the folkways and mores and the religious beliefs, no longer conform to the more secular interests and practices of everyday life. When the younger generation loses cultural contact with the elder, or when one section or class of the community ceases to function in conformity with the interest and ideals of the community as a whole, the problem of education is to re-establish communication and to reweave the web of intimate and personal relations of individuals, constituting the older and younger generations, as well as the diverse regions, in order to achive understanding and revive the loyalties upon which the moral, as distinguished from the economic and political order, rest. It is the function of news and, more especially, of art, literature, and the humanities to create the understandings which make for moral unity solidarity in the community, in so far as it can be created and maintained by art, literature, and formal education."

A cross‐sectional, time‐series, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios (municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10‐year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios. These results suggest that the curvilinear relationship between the structure of political opportunities and protest mobilization posited to explain social movements in well‐developed Western democracies does not explain the development of the protest cycle of a new social movement in an emerging electoral democracy."

The conclusion is that the Ottoman and Iranian legal assemblies, which were buttressed by extraparaliamentary and extralegal resources, were far more powerful and effective.

This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."

Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self‐sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments.

Each of Lamming's novels exercises a different degree of ""cultural power,"" and this capacity to engender multiple meanings while retaining coherence shows that cultural meanings emerge from the interaction between cultural works of varying power and human recipients of varying expectations and concerns. In turn, this interaction suggests a theory of metaphor that enables research in the sociology of culture to utilize both cultural and sociological data without reducing one to the other."

It remained medieval in spirit longest where the opportunities for participation in capitalistic secular culture were most restricted. In more recent times the increasing migration of Jews to the urban areas of advanced capitalistic nations has tended to weaken the influence of religious education with all but the nationalist groups. For the most part, Jewish learning now serves only as a supplement to the secular public education. The contrast between the highly urbanized, sophisticated Jews and the Negroes is great.

Second, the type of control group used was correlated with the measured effect of desegregation: studies which used random-assignment experimental designs found significantly stronger treatment effects, while studies which compared black achievement growth either to that of white students or to achievement test norms found much weaker (usually negative) treatment effects.

Each new situation in the past has added some element to this petterned ""inner"" life as we see it now. Elaborate life-histories are necessary in reconstructing this past. The approach is not that of the psychiatrist, but an attempt to determine how culture is transmitted and how, from the sociological point of view, the personality in question arose. The nice problem will probably prove to be the relative evaluation of the existing milieu, with its point of significant support and stress, and the force of highly fixed inner definitions tending toward pathological interpretations of existing situations and consequent pathological response."

The benefits of transformation are limited, however, and organizational change increases the risk of failure with little evidence of a declining effect over time. In the long run, this shapes the organizational system in ways that potentially improve its legitimacy but may also limit the development of an infrastructure for future mobilization."

This paper concerns the extent to which economic action is embedded in structures of social relations, in modern industrial society. Although the usual neoclasical accounts provide an ""undersocialized"" or atomized-actor explanation of such action, reformist economists who attempt to bring social structure back in do so in the ""oversocialized"" way criticized by Dennis Wrong. Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures. The argument in illustrated by a critique of Oliver Williamson's ""markets and hierarchies"" research program."

This paper describes paths in research and in theory development, that will reconstitute relevance of each for the other. The essential elements are two. The first is use of a theory of purposive action as a foundation for social theory; this entails acceptance of a form of methodological individualism and rejection of holism. The second is a focus in social research and theory on the movement from the level of individual actions to macrosocial functioning, that is, the level of system behavior."

The present paper argues that the perstige of occupations, as it is ordinarily graded, is a simple average of these two dimensions, implying that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that assessments of prestige do in fact involve considerations of economic reward, an it employs the data in conjunction with this well-grounded assumption to infer what other considerations must be involved. The argument is prosecuted by means of polar coordinate analysis. This method is applicable because R2 for the regression of social standing (taken to be a synonym for prestige) on other aspects of occupation is close to one; and virtually all the variance of each vector of occupational assessment lies in a space of three dimensions. The final discussion suggests that, although the data point to the existence of a normative consensus, this consensus bears little relation to prestige in its traditional prestige which bolsters the elite is a fragile thing, whereas the normative consensus on occupational prestige may constitute an important source of legitimation of the distribution of social rewards."

Hypotheses are derived from the international migration literature and the market transition debate. The results are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from cumulative causation of migration; however, geographical location creates some differences in migration patterns to the United States. In China as in Mexico, the existence of migration networks increases the propensity of migration for others in the community. In contrast to the Mexican case, among Chinese immigrants, having a previously migrated household member increases the propensity of other household members to migrate only after the debt for previous migration is paid off. In step with market transition theory, the authors also find that political power influences the migration experience from the coastal Fujian Province."

Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market—a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action problems. The author develops a different account by viewing institutions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing conflict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental certification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market‐based approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the “political construction of market institutions.” The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms."

The fields of art and science were considered essentially antithetical in methodology as well as in practice. Art was the product of the intuition of the privileged man, and science of the disciplined reason which almost anyone could exercise. Although the ""great man theory"" of art still lingers, there is evidence of an interest in the social analysis of aesthetic culture. Aesthetic culture has been variously conceived as a ""social luxury,"" as a reflection of its age, as an autonomous experience, as an escape from personal disorganization. From the critique of these theories it is apparent that beauty is a folkway that is buttressed by rationalizations that are linked to certain circumstances. It is almost more plausible to state that the theory of art is socially conditioned that that art itself is so determined."

We examine this question in the context of high-status corporate law firms, which often diversify into one low-status area of work—family law (FL)—but face a barrier (strong disapproval from existing clients) that prevents diversification into another such area—plaintiffs’ personal injury law (PIL). Drawing on a qualitative study of the Boston legal market, we argue that this barrier reflects a situation where loyalty norms have been violated, and it surfaces because service to individual plaintiffs is tantamount to betraying the interests of corporate clients. Our analysis clarifies identity-based limits to diversification, indicating that they are rooted in concerns about the firm’s commitments as well as its capabilities, and suggests a more general refinement of theory on status and conformity."

Although syndicating originated among the relatively poor as a response to an increase in lottery prices, it persisted even when individual play became affordable. This article contends that syndicating endured because of an institutionalization process by which lottery tickets have transformed from purely economic assets into symbolic carriers of interpersonal ties that convey membership and status position in relevant social networks."

The game-theoretic solution centers on the opportunity for tacit collusion in repeated play. However, not all actors grasp the strategic implications of future interaction. Accordingly, this study reformulates the game as a stochastic learning model in which the behavior of interdependent actors is constinually shaped by sanctions and cues generated by their interaction. Computer simulations of a two-person game show that adaptive actors are led into a social trap more readily than are fully rational actors, but they are also better at finding their way out. Prosocial norms appear to be a consequence rather than cause of cooperation but useful in promoting forgiveness of random deviance. The model is then elaborated as an N-way Prisoner's Dilemma. Simulations show how the effects of network size, density, mobility, and anonymity derive from a fundamental principle of collective action, that is, the need to reduce the number of choices that must be fortuitously coordinated in order to escape noncooperative equilibrium. The results also suggest how network structure might evolve in tandem with the cooperation it facilitates."

Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of ""connection"" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types."

A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity.

This bipolarity of parachuting provides a rare opportunity to study a nearly ideal-typical manifestation of extreme opposite social forms contained within a organizational setting. The sequence of the three phases of the jump, and the dialectical relationship among them, is analyzed here in terms of personal regression leading to social regression, and vice versa.

Three characteristics of a field—the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks—determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making.

A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach."

This article addresses this question by clarifying when computer firms were most strongly affected by the choices of their structurally equivalent rivals to adopt a well‐known technology: Intel’s sixth‐generation processor. The core hypothesis is that the effect of adoptions by structurally equivalent firms increases with the competitive pressure that a focal firm faces in its market position. The results show that a chosen firm is most strongly influenced by comparable others when it faces scale‐based competition and is diversified. The implications of this study are twofold: a social actor’s sensitivity to the conduct of others may depend not only on its place in a hierarchy but also on the nature of its ties to an external audience; and a contingent theory of social influence may be necessary to characterize diffusion processes correctly, particularly when external and time‐varying nonnetwork factors have significant effects."

Genomic causation is described from a counterfactualist perspective, which makes its complexity plain and highlights the distinction between identifying causes and substantiating explanations. For explanation, genomic causes must be understood as strictly mediated by the body. One implication is that the challenge of behavioral genetics for sociology is much more a challenge from psychology than biology, and a main role for genetics is as a placeholder for ignorance of more proximate influences of psychological and other embodied variation. Social scientists should not take this challenge from psychology as suggesting any especially fundamental explanatory place for either it or genetics, but the contingent importance of genetic and psychological characteristics is itself available for sociological investigation."

Reputations depend on the ""embeddedness"" of interactions in structures or networks of social relations. They illustrate the effects of such embeddedness on the outcomes of interactions.This article presents simple game-theoretic models of reputation effects on efficiency (in the Pareto sense) in interactions. In a comparative perspective, the authors start with a baseline model of a social system in which reputation effects (of a specific kind) are excluded: actors do not receive information on their partners' behavior in interactions with third parties. Such a system of ""atomized interactions"" is compared to a system with interactions that are ""perfectly embedded"": actors are immediately informed on all interactions of their partners with third parties.Efficiency is more easily attained as a result of individually rational behavior in perfectly embedded systems. In a final step, the comparative perspective is broadened, and the extreme assumptions of either an atomized or a perfectly embedded social system replaced. Intermediate cases arise in the consideration of ""imperfect embededness,"" that is, a situation in which actors are informed only after some time lag on the behavior of their partners vis-a-vis third parties. It is shown that the conditions for efficiency become more restrictive as the information time lag lengthens."

The effect of interagency relations is demonstrated through an examination of India and Korea. Both have worked to foster industrialization, and both are endowed with relatively healthy bureaucracies. However, the Indian state was paralyzed and fragmented, while its Korean counterpart did secure the requisite internal coherence. Not only did the culture of rule following fail to generate a cohesive state in India, but it, in fact, worked against such an outcome."

Findings consistently show a significant reciprocal relationship between gun ownership levels and the homicide rate, with crime pushing up gun ownership and gun ownership in turn pushing up the homicide rate. Greater certainty of arrest and conviction for homicide has a significant negative effect on the homicide rate, suggesting a deterrent effect of legal sanctions, while the homicide rate in turn has a negative effect on the certainty of punishment. This is consistent with a hypothesis of the strain on cirminal justice system resources resulting from increasing crime. Further, the hypothesis that the imprisonment o criminal offenders has an incapacitative effect on homicide rates independent of deterrence effects is supported. Contrary to the recent findings of Ehrlich (1975b), the analysis fails to detect consistent evidence of a deterrent effect of capital punishment on U.S. homicide rates for 1947-73. This may be because of the infrequency of executions during this period."

Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies."

It shows that in discussing content and interorganizational relationships, the newsman can only invoke his news judgment; however, he can claim objectivity by citing procedures he has followed which exemplify the formal attributes of a news history or a newspaper.

This constitutive difficulty presents itself today in ways that have instructive parallels to the problem constellation confronting the first generation of 20th-century sociological classics. Karl Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929) was extraordinarily successful in Germany at the historical turning point of the Weimar Republic. This marks him as a representative figure among those contemporaries who acknowledged the force of ""irrationalist"" criticisms of progressive liberalism but sought to contain the destructive dynamics of such criticisms within a new type of rational framework, both intellectual and political. The article contrasts Mannheim's encounters with antirationalist thought in Ideologie un Utopie with the later pragmatist instrumental rationalism of his writings in English exile. In analyzing the shift, special attention is paid to Mannheim's involvement in Paul Tillich's religious socialist circle and to confrontations between Mannheim and Georg Lukacs, Oscar jaszi, Eduard Heimann, Max Hrkheimer, and Theodor W. Adorno. Newly discovered letters and transcripts are use to specify these relationships. Mannheim's promising theoretical beginnings were disruped by the brute facts of his generation's biography.

This article inventories Weber's usage of ""rationality"" and ""rationalization"" in ""Economy and Society"" and the ""Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion."" Four types of rationality are identified and compared with one another: practical, theoretical, substantive, and formal. Only ""ethical substantive rationality"" introduces methodical ways of life. All four types become manifest in a multiplicity of rationalization processes orchestrated at all levels of societal and civilization process. Long-term rationalization processes are seen to be rooted in values rather than in interests. The dominance of practical, theoretical, and formal rationalization processes in modern Western societies implies immense consequences for the type of person likely to live in these societies."

Each trait model is typical of the over-all societal culture or of one or another group subculture. Individuals shift attitudes as they shift roles (and thus group contexts) in response to changes in situation. This is attitudinal multivalence. Its most significant aspect is sentiment multivalence, consequent to the internalization of more or less contradictory morals and mores. Both anthropologists and psychiatrists report considerable data explainable in terms of this multivalence, but they do not relate attitudes to social structure through culture and the subcultures."

Intelligence plays a key role in mediating the influence of social origins on educational outcomes. Further, there is little evidence that teachers discriminate by socioeconomic origin. School differences in educational outcomes are small and may be artifactual consequences of differences in student-body composition. High school quality is less persistent over time than student-body composition, and plays a minor role in the determination of ultimate educational attainment."

An examinatin of this deviant case is pursued by consideration of the various mechanisms dependency theorists claim are responsible for the linkage of foreign economic penetration to stagnation and inequality. In the Taiwan case, none of these mechanisms work out as predicated. Instead, a variety of factors-including the nature of the Japanese colonial experience, the emphasis on labor-intensive enterprise, and the absence of an entrenched burgeoisie-created a situation in which both rapid growth and increasing equality could occur. Consideration of Taiwan draws attention to flaws in the arguments of most dependency theorists and suggests a more optimistic picture for at least some developing societies that have to deal with foreign economic penetration."

Some recent approaches start with and revise an individually focused, rational action framework. While this orientation to building transdisciplinary, multilevel models provides many insights, it fails to capture essential features of social life. The social organization strategy (SOS) framework presented in this article offers a complementary approach to social action in general and decision making in particular. This orientation, a network and event-centered counterpart to rational choice, rests on fundamental principles that distinguish the discipline of sociology: social interaction is the basis of social life, and social networks provide the mechanism (interaction) through which individuals learn about, come to understand, and attempt to handle difficulties. This approach shifts the from individual ""choice"" to socially constructed patterns of decisions, including consultation with others. Utilization research in medical sociology serves as a case for reviewing theoretical approaches to decision making and provides the background necessary to a theoretical exposition of the SOS approach using data from the National Survey of Access to Medical Care (1975-76.) The results support the utility of pursuing the SOS framework."

The other group conceives social nature to be developed through interaction from an active but relatively amorphous and plastic original nature. The basic differences between the two groups of students seem to be inherent and irreconcilable, but the fundamental character of the disagreement is not always recognized."

Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor’s degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor’s degree alone."

Respect for native values should be maintained along with the equipment for co-operation with the European community.

Males and females were assigned to the high or low position of structural power/dependency in power-imbalanced dyads, with a partner of the same or opposite sex and with power assignments based on competence (legitimation) or chance. The results indicate that the sex of the more powerful person did not affects power use. Overall power use was affected primarily by the sex of the less powerful person;it was greater when that dyad member was male. The process of power use (wether behavioral influence was ever attempted, and, if so, what patterns of influence were used) was examined to help explain these findings. This analysis revealed effects of legitimation on the dyads with powerful females and helped to explain the effects of the weaker person's sex on power use. Instead of providing unequivocal support for any one of the three theories, the results suggest that structure, socialization, and status expectations are complexly interrelated in their effects on power use."

A distinction is made between two classes of knowledge: the core, or fully evaluated and universally accepted ideas which serve as the starting points for graduate education, and the research frontier, or all research currently being conducted. Data are presented from a set of empirical studies which show that, at the top and at the bottom of the hierarchy in either cognitive consensus or the rate at which new ideas are incorporated. It is concluded that in all sciences knowledge at the research frontier is a loosely woven web characterized by substantial levels of disagreement and difficulty in determining which contributions will turn out to be significant.

Using the concept of lustration systems, this study differentiates three archetypes: dismissal, exposure, and confession. The authors propose that each system carries different symbolic meanings, which produce different outcomes for citizens’ trust in government and in tainted officials. The hypothesized effects of different lustration systems on trust are tested by an experiment embedded in nationwide representative surveys conducted in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The results show that dismissal and confession increase citizens’ trust in government and trust in tainted officials. However, exposure reduces citizens’ trust in tainted officials."

Conduct is held to be a continuous activity, broken down perceptually into acts. Social acts are analyzable according to the situation to which they refer and the way in which actors attempt to exert control over others. Four forms of social act are distinguished, differing according to their degree of obliquity from direct control. Acts are also distinguished according to their level of organization, ranging from spontaneous to sophisticated. Sophisticated acts involve instrumental use of routine action. Social change occurs when routine substitute fail in their purpose of control."

This article makes such an attempt with all Western European countries experiencing democratic rule between 1870 and 1939. It seeks (1) to explain what structural and historical features distinguish the breakdown cases from those that remained democratic, and (2) to trace the process of class coalition formation in the transition to democracy and the subsequent breakdown. Moore's thesis does fit, with some modification. All four breakdwn cases were characterized historically by an authoritarian coalition of labor-repressive landlords, the state, and the bourgeoisie that contributed to the breakdown of democratic rule in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast, in none of the democratic survivors did such a coalition materialize. This difference can be traced largely to the strenght of the agrarian elite in the late 19th century. However, in contrast to Moore's characterization of the conservative authoritarian path, the ruling coalition, except in Germany, did not play a modernizing role, and only in Austria can the bourgeoisie be described as a ""dependent"" partner in the coalition. Moreover, because it stops too early, Moore's analysis greatly underplays the role of the organized working class in the transition to democracy and attributes far too positive a role to the bourgeoisie."

To the extent that thought of divorce relates to eventual divorce, these findings imply that the husband's earnings and the presence of children may deter divorce less now than they have in the past."

Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing a fourfold typology of workers’ responses, the author shows how each type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the restructuring of their jobs."

The first, commonly associated with ""postindustrial theory,"" sees work as becoming more humanized, more autonomous, less routinized; the second image, associated with Marxist theories of proletarianization, sees work as becoming more routinized and degraded, with less autonomy and responsibility for the worker. The debate between these two perspectives has largely been waged at the theoretical level, with at best anecdotal evidence in support of one side or the other. This study uses national data to make a preliminary assessment of the adequacy of each perspective. The central analytical strategy is to decompose total changes in the degree of proletarianization into two components: an industry-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes in the overall sectoral distribution of the labor force across industries; and a class-composition-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes within given sectors. Contrary to the expectations of postindustrial theory, it is demonstrated that there is a strong and consistent proletarianization process within sectors. This proletarianization process is hidden from view because of the strength of a counteracting process in the industry-shift effect (i.e., the relatively more rapid expansion of those sectors which were relatively less proletarianized in the first place). The paper concludes with a discussion of the likely transformation of the class structure in the remaining part of the century. It is predicted that this counteracting tendency will weaken, and thus a clearer process of aggregate proletarianization should appear in the next decades."

The general existence of patnership structures with the property that no one has an incentive to separate has been established. These equilibrium structures maximize aggregate ""value"" over the set of all feasible match structures in the transferable utility case. According to this pure theory of matching, competition for partners can be expected to yield equilibrium match structures that are both stable and socially efficient, at least under conditions of frictionless certainty. Search-theoretic models that take account of meeting costs and initial uncertainty about match values have been developed to explain separation behavior as a process of shopping for a ""good match."" These models suggest several possible social inefficiencies in the match formation and separation processes. Finally, labor economists have recently provided empirical evidence that supports this view of the process."

Mead thought to facilitate the solution of this problem by showing that as psychological the individual is social. The technique of his psychology is that of role-assumption: by acting as others, one finally becomes others to himself. From oscillating others, ""a generalized other"" arises to constitute from the flowing selves a more or less abiding self. But this self isa ""socius"": reflecting, like a true microcosm, the dissonance as well as the harmony of the societal macrocosm. Mead thought to show as his social philosophy that amelioration flows differentially from his account of the self. In this he was not wholly successful. The self resulting from Mead's analysis is descriptively social but no more ethically so than is the community that begets it; and of the moral quality of actually existing communities Mead had no high opinion. His interest in amelioration flowed from the man he was rather than from his doctrine of the self. His social philosophy is generous; his social psychology probably true; but the two were connected by his personality rather than by his logic."

Religion, social class, and ideology produce sharp distinctions that are incorporated into all aspects of the political life of the country. With pressures from secularization and rising living standards, it can be questioned from secularization and rising living standards, it can be questioned whether current voter loyalties should be solely related to historic ties with parties. A survey conducted in Austria in 1968 demonstrated that, beyond the organizational continuity of parties and the persistence of social cleavages, there was a separate line of continuity for partisan stability associated with the nature of group ties. While the group benefits that come from a particular party are not always evident, the social bonds linking individuals to parties in a sense bypass this political content. Some of the qualities of Austrian political life for example, the lengthy experience of a coalition government that established a system for sharing administrative offices on the basis of party affiliation are unique, but this should not obscure the more general relevance of the findings: that primary group ties continue to have a political importance even when the structural bases of the ties are weakened."

These two related dimensions of political information processing emerge from a detailed content analysis of depth interview transcripts. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the way citizens relate the condition of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and to political authorities. As expected, education plays a central role in explaning these patterns, but there are some surprising interactive linkages between education and patterns of political thought. One specially intriguing finding is that conservatives have significantly lower scores than liberals on indices of differentiation and integration.

There are also important divergencies between the two fields. And in so far as the aesthetic and neurotic fields diverge, there must be a corresponding difference in co-ordinates. Freud's perspective, developed primarily for the charting of neurosis, is better suited to the margin of overlap than to the area of divergency. As regards the margin of overlap, two modifications of Freudian co-ordinates are offered: (1) A poem's structure should be discussed as a recipe or synthesis of several motives rather than in terms of one essential motive with all others treated as derivatives from it; (2) Freud's overly patriarchal emphasis obscures the matriarchal factors operating in literary works that symbolize a change of lineage or identity. As regards the area of divergency, Freud's co-ordinates, in stressing the poem as dream, understress the poem as a communicative structure and as a realistic gauging of human situations. Communication, rather than wish fulfilment, is the key term for literary analysis."

While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this “false enforcement” in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer’s genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another."

Occupation‐based models of social mobility, however, have limitations that arguably have grown in recent decades. Meta‐analysis of available evidence for Sweden, western Germany, and the United States concerning occupational mobility, household income mobility, job displacement, union dissolution, and poverty dynamics shows the limitations of the individual‐level occupation‐based career‐trajectory approach to life course mobility. This article develops an alternative formulation at the household level, which focuses on cross‐national variation in the extent to which societal institutions influence the rate of events with the potential to change a household’s life conditions via the manipulation of incentives for mobility‐generating events, and the extent to which they mitigate the consequences of these events through social insurance. The combination of these institutional processes produces the distinctive characteristics of the mobility regimes of these countries."

Drawing on evidence from the German Democratic Republic, as well as other cases, the article develops a dramaturgical framework that classifies contentious repertoires along three dimensions: behavior, standpoint, and stance. This framework is then used to analyze two types of data: a retrospective “resistance” narrative by an ordinary citizen and a secret transcript from the well‐known Biermann protest.

Significant intra-church consequences flow from these differences.

Causal inferences from such associations have been plagued by the possibility of selection bias. Using a new method for sensitivity analysis, these effects are shown to be robust to selection bias. Unobserved factors would have to be unreasonably strong to account for the associations between neighborhood and the outcomes."

Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives.

Though a philosopher, he deserves the attention of the sociologist because of the hypotheses and thought models he offers. Sartre starts from a phenomenologist epistemology. Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that it is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances. Thus, whoever, in man's universal condition, chooses freedom chooses it for everybody. Lately Sartre's view of freedom has been modified in that he attributes greater importance to social and economic conditions surrounding man's choice. Others constitute infringements upon man's freedom. But man needs the other because cannot realize himself except in the other's eyes. Communication is possible only by mutual role-taking. Language is made while it is spoken, not used as a ready-made commodity. In a study of anti-Semitism, Sartre outlines four types-the anti-Semite, the democrat, the authentic Jew, and the inauthentic Jew-which are products of free choice in a more or less constraining environment. He suggests the classless society as the remedy for anti-Semitism. Sartre's ethics may be useful to the teacher of sociology becauses its assumptions are compatible with those of science."

The concept of ""culture,"" developed by anthropologists, reflects the integrated body of conventional understandings corresponding to a self-sufficient community, as observed in folk life. Other characteristics of anthropological analysis of society, as contrasted with sociological, similarly expressive of the nature of folk society, are the disposition to represent the society and culture in terms of ""pattern"" or ""structure""; the relatively small development of problems of sampling, the emphasis on formalized kinship institutions, and certain emphasis of meaning in such words as ""status"" and ""class.""

For many leisure is only rest or entertainment, but it is important to life constructively. Beset with dangers, it still is of evolutional value, enabling education, imagination, progressive adventure. Three eras of leisure.-Witness the leisure afforded by long infancy and youth, in some sense the basis of man's superiority. Witness, againg the leisure and culture made possible by slavery domestic and proprietary or socially institutional. Witness, thirdly, the leisure which has been coming to man through automatic machinery, the ""Iron Man,"" and which offers such adventure, such mixed danger and opportunity, as history has never known. The new leisure and industrial democracy.-With this third leisure must be associated the call for an industrial democracy. All democracy would free men from some subjection and insure to all in some measure and to many in large measure the leisure attending the liberation and also the opportunity and importance attending the leisure; and, as to democracy today, with so much automatic and dehumanized instrumentation of life, leisure might properly even be added as a fourth natural right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. The servile class, then, servants, laborers, even soldiers, would participate in the results, benefits, and responsibilities of modern mechanical automatistm. With the new leisure a new culture.-As leisure through non-human instruments must have a quality different from that resting on slavery or on any labor and fatigue of man's own kind, so the culture and adventure enabled or actually incited by it must be different. There is no universal culture, any culture always being a specific answer to the challenge in the peculiar restraining instruments of its time. Thus the challenge of today comes from the Iron Man, the Giant Automaton, and no former culture can answer. Analogously, Virgil may have accompanied Dante, but he could not have replaced him."

Empirical, historical, historical analysis is utilized to explore the relative saliency of three determinants of political power to explain variation in power as defined conceptually and operationally independent from its determinants. The determinants are magnitude, the extent to which the group is tied into economic, political, and social networks, and the degree of mobilization. The aspect of power investigated is the vesting of economic interests, that is, the extent to which the interests of an actor are taken into account by the government in its routine operation. Regression analysis is used to assess the relative explanatory power of the magnitude, network relations, and degree of mobilization of 12 industries on the vesting of economic interests in the U.S. Department of State in the period 1886-1905. Results show that the different components have different explanatory value under varying conditions, depending on the type of interest that is vested. When the State Department was discussing export-related matters the value of exports was the best predictor of vesting, with mobilization having a secondary impact. However, the effect of network relations was notably weak, contrary to predictions of the power-elite perspective.

To attempt an answer, we shall compare the major dimensions in the experience of young people within one city prior to and during early industrialization. In particular, three broad issues frame our inquiry into specific patterns of residence, education, work, and marriage and into the way in which class and ethnicity affected the shape of experience. Those three issues are universality of adolescence, the relations between parents and children, and the social consequences of public education. We begin with the issues."

The small world network effect was parabolic; performance increased up to a threshold, after which point the positive effects reversed."

Drawing on core insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge, it highlights, and then challenges, a fundamental principle underlying our understanding of technological risk: a realist epistemology that tacitly assumes that technological knowledge is objectively knowable and that “failures” always connote “errors” that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the “epistemic accident,” grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."

The ratio of managers, proprietors, and officials to the employed labor force measures the concentration of power, and success in urban renewal is represented by arrival of cities at the execution stage in that program. The relationship is found to be statistically significant and remains so under a series of controlled observations. Thus it appears that the conception of power employed offers a promising procedure for comparative studies."

Two components of social desirability-""trait desirability"" and ""need for siscal approval""-are examined to assess the extent to which they effect people's responses to several sociological measures (e.g., happiness, religiosity). This analysis reveals that both components of a social-desirability response set, while generally unrelated to one another, are independently related to our dependent variables, people's responses on the various measures. The more important of the two components, trait desirability, is then examined with regard to its effect on the relationship between people's sexual status and the dependent variables. This introduction to the analysis of trait desirability as a test factor tends to specify both the magnitude and the direction of the original relationships involving sexual status. Finally, the results are discussed with regard to their implications for the validity of various sociological measures and the validity of the sociological investigator's findings."

This pattern is also alleged to account for the growth in racial inequality in wages over the same period. This article reports on a case study of the retooling of a food processing plant. A unique, longitudinal, multimethod design reveals the nature of the technological change, the changes in job requirements, and the mechanisms by which the changes affect the wage distribution for hourly production workers. This research finds that, indeed, the retooling resulted in greater wage dispersion and that the changes have also been associated with greater racial inequality in wages. However, contrary to the claims of advocates of the skill‐bias hypothesis, organizational and human resources factors strongly mediated the impact of the changing technology. Absent these “high road” organizational choices, this impact on wage distribution would have been even more extreme."

Usual analyses of this phenomenon invoke conceptions of authority to explain it implicitly, or they propose that the asymmetry of clinical discourse relies solely on an institutional basis. In order to discover and analyze interactional aspects of the clinical encounter, comparative studies between institutional and everyday contexts are necessary. This article demonstrates that, through the use of a conversational ""perspective display series,"" which is adapted to the clinical environment, a delivery of ""bad"" diagnosis news can coimplicate the patient's perspective and promote understanding and the appearance of agreement between clinician and patient. In general, describing manifestations of institutional power and authority should include analysis of the ways that participants organize interaction in the first place."

These conditions interacted with the diverse and, in part, contrary value-orientations of the individual conscientious objectors.

The analysis focuses on the role of state laws and regulations in the expansion of the mortgage‐backed securities markets and the development of real estate investment trusts (REITs). These institutional developments represent a series of ad hoc state efforts to “delocalize” residential and commercial property, and embed real estate financing within global capital markets. Rather than viewing globalization as weakening the state, the author argues that the U.S. state’s capacity to influence the degree and development of liquidity is a powerful mechanism of globalization."

The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners."

Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285"

For the first time, we are able to take account of the effect of annexation and can see the actual extent to which the expansion of city boundaries tends to mask the ammount of ""decetralization"" or ""suburbanization"" that has been taking place. Considering the nation as a whole, the unajusted data show that rings grew about four and a half times as fast as the cities they surround, and the that these outlying parts of SMSA's captured just over three-fourths of the total increase going to metropolitan areas. When adjusted for annexations by central cities, however, the data reveal that the rings grew over forty times as fast as the cities as bounded in 1950, and that the suburban rings captured almost 97 per cent of the total metropolitan increase. Before annexation was taken into account, 64 SMSA's appeared to have been ""centralizing,"" but this number was reduced to eight when city boundaries were held constant."

(I) All sociologists should use technical terms in the same sense. Terms are to be judged by their serviceability, which is measured in part by disjunctiveness, inclusiveness, and fewness of the concepts proposed. Methodology should tend to lead to fresh discoveries. (2) The process of competition is the physical aspect of the social reality; it determines the spatial and economic organization of human society, and affords a starting-point for the study of other social processes. (3) Conflict and accommodation are processes which involve the ""personal"" type of interaction. Conflict arises out of conflicting claims, and accommodation is the process in which an equilibration of conflict through redefinition of claims is established. (4) Conflict, accommodation, and assimilation are processes in which control is established. Assimilation is the process in which persons develop sympathetic responsiveness to one another's claims. (5) the concepts proposed here are intended to make possible somewhat complete accounts of reactions evoked by social contact. The immediate reduction of the social reality to description in more ultimate terms tends to obscure some of its features. (6) The actual social reality may be abstracted in substantive or in active terms. The reality is in fact a process of becoming, but the concept of becoming, unless broken up into small units connected with types of social interaction, is not serviceable for scientific purposes."

However, there are different levels of distinctness, some more subtle than others. These levels are determined by the theoretical context of the research. Failure to specify the theoretical context creates ambiguity as to the level of distinctness, and leads to the partialling fallacy, in which one controls for variables that are  distinct in terms of appropriate theory. Although this can occur in using any control procedure, it is especially likely to occur in multiple regression, where high-order partial regression coefficients are routinely obtained in order to determine the relative importance of variables. Four major ways in which these regression coefficients can be seriously misleading are discussed. Although warnings concerning multicollinearity are to be found in statistics texts, they are insufficiently informative to prevent the mistakes described here.

Important differences in the extent of change are observed among Catholics. The sources of these changing characteristics of Detroit families, particularly changing levels of education. Only about 25%-30% of the differential change among religio-ethnic categories can be attributed to such factors. Apart from these considerations, the changing alues of Detroit Catholics are nonetheless significant, and these trends are interpreted as the major source of aggregate social change observed in the Detroit surveys. These results are consistent with other evidence regarding the recent historical movement of Catholics away from what are often considered traditional definitions of family relationships. In addition, the results of this analysis suggest that, although education consistently affects parental values across time, occupation may be declining in its importance as a determinant of those values."

The generalization conservation of compatibles invites reconsideration of the entire record of the human process on the fact side, and further use of the hypothesis for criticism of conduct values."

The results support this argument: changes in fluidity between the mid‐1970s and late 1990s were due to the successive replacement of older and less fluid, by younger and more fluid, cohorts. Cohorts differed in their fluidity because the effect of class origins on educational attainment declined (an equalization effect) and because greater shares of each cohort had higher levels of educational attainment, which placed them in labor markets that operate more meritocratically (a compositional effect).

One overriding conclusion is that, contrary to the claims of its proponents, the ordinal strategy is no better than the parametric strategy at meeting some of the basic requirements of multivariate analysis.

The first section documents changes in the control systems that prevailed in U.S. industries between the Depression and the end of World War II. The descriptive analyses generally corroborate portraits that have recently been provided by neo-Marxists of how and where technical and bureaucratic controls evolved. The second section sketches and explanation for the rapid diffusion of bureaucratic controls that apparently occurred between 1939 and 1946. It examines the role of three key constituencies in shaping modern system of work force control: labor unions, personnel professionals, and the state. In particular, the analyses underscore the large role of government intervention in manpower activities during World War II in bureaucratizing employment. This effect of the state blurs the distinction between ""efficiency"" and ""control"" explanations of bureaucratic controls and internal labor markets, calling attention to institutional sources of change in organizations' employment structures. The concluding section highlights the implications of the findings for efforts to understand the employment relationship."

Treating public attention as a scarce resource, the model emphasizes competition and selection in the media and other arenas of public discourse. Linkages among public arenas produce feedback that drives the growth of social problems. Growth is constrained by the finite ""carrying capacities"" of public arenas, by competition, and by the need for sustained drama. The tension between the constraints and forces for growth produces successive waves of problem definitions, as problems and those who promote them compete to enter and to remain on the public agenda. Suggestions for empirical tests of the model are specified."

Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, which includes a subsample of twins, this study evaluates the relationship between happiness and various features of success before and after eliminating the influence of endowments. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Yet the results also suggest that the role of genetic endowments varies considerably across different features of success, suggesting complex patterns of selection, reinforcement, and causation among genes and the environment."

The more important parts of the analysis developed from this theory can be carried out by elementary methods and therefore require no great mathematical or statistical sophistication. In several illustrative data sets, the observed changes are adequately accounted for with a model allowing no causal relationship between the two latent variables or their observable indicators. In other examples, a model of asymmetric causation is plausible; in still others, the situation is so complex that a convincing causal interpretation, excluding rival interpretations, is not available. The basic form of the latent-trait model can be modified to include parameters pertaining to association of the observed indicators. This modification is especially appropriate when the two variables arise from parallel observations on the memebers of dyads rather than from observations on two distict items (attitudes, actions) pertaining to individual respondent. Limitations of the illustrative analyses reported here are, for the most part, intrinsic to the 16-fold table itself, whatever the analytical strategy, or are shared with other forms of survey analysis. The latent-trait approach, however, may make such limitations easier to see."

The comparative interest focused on two features: (1) the presumed sharper discontinuity of French class structure compared with the more diffuse American system; and (2) the supposed differences in mobility attitudes in the two countries. Structure and attitudes are commonly taken as conditioners of the mobility experience, moderating or heightening its hypothesized effects on (for example) feelings of social isolation, ethnic prejudice, sense of relative deprivation, and political radicalism or conservatism. The analysis, however, argues strongly in support of French-American similarity rather than difference, in two major respects: (1) mobility attitudes showed the same basic structure and correlation pattern; and (2) as expected, the effects which can be attributed to objective mobility were highly limited in both countries."

We also suggest strategic advantages of individual event data over the aggregate analyses which dominate empirical studies of these issues. Our results indicate that work stoppages are more likely to become violent when they are large in size and long in duration and occur over multiple issues; some of our negative findings on other issue dimensions challege long-standing assumptions in conflict theory. We then analyze the relationship between violence and strike outcomes and find that, net of other determinants, violent strikes are less likely to end in success for workers."

A variant of legal evolution theory, based on a model suggested by Turner, is used to explore the determinants of legal differentiation in this case. Documentary sources and quantitative data from state juvenile codes and census records are used to show, first, that the establishment of juvenile reformatories was a necessary precondition for changes in the legal status of children and, second, that the diffusion of reformatories is explainable, not by modernization in general but rather by a combination of semi-independent socioecomonic, cultural, and political factors."

In each case, events follow a power law spanning two or three orders of magnitude. A similar pattern is found for strikes in Paris from 1890 to 1899.

Several writers have argued that authoritarianism results, at least in part, from the lack of broad social perspectives. However, they have not made it sufficiently clear how breadth of perspective operates to discourage authoritarianism and how it relates to more than one or two of the several components of the authoritarianism complex. By specifically taking account of the particular world view which underlies the interdependent characteristics of authoritarianism, it is possible to explicate the relationship between breadth of perspective and authoritarianism. This world view seems impressively similar to the concept of ""reification,"" as described explicitly or implicitly by a number of social theorists. It is maintained here that reification is induced by narrow perspectives and diminished by broadened perspectives. An ""authoritarian personality"" is not a prerequisite for such reification. But many of the characteristics of authoritarianism can result from this orientation toward social reality."

The account of ""confirming allusions"" is offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic techniques.

The attempt to put war into a biological category errs not so much from a failure to distinguish between social and biological aspects of war as from failure to distinguish between competition and conflict as different aspects of the ""struggle for existence."" Competition may be regarded as an individuating or analytic process; conflict as an integrating process. Wars have provided the necessity for an organization of society which, for the purpose of collective action at least, has become immeasurably superior to the primitive horde. The state not only had its origin in war, but its chief function continues to be preparation for and execution of war. Where no common interests or ""constitutional understandings"" exist to make compromise possible, wars seem inevitable. Ideological wars turn out to be struggles for land because political control and sovereignty of territory are necessary to maintain the different ways of life represented by the parties to these conflicts. The function of war has been (I) to extend the area of peace, (2) to create within that area a political power capable of enforcing it, and (3) to establish an ideology which rationalizes and a cult which idealizes the new political and social order."

This article is a preliminary examination of how the U.S. Senate moved from a strong pro-involvement stance to a strong anti-involvement one.

Theoretical implications and research proposals are discussed."

Teachers were most likely to act in accord with their predisposition when they received social support from colleagues and were not under cross-pressure.Four different types of cross-pressure led teachers to avoid making a clear decision. Teachers who supported the union but feared sanctions were less likely to picket than those who did not fear sanctions. The social-psychological and structural determinants of fear are examined. Teachers who were negatively predisposed toward the strike but had colleagues as a salient reference group were less likely to cross the picket line than those who did not have colleagues as a reference group. Knowing whether or not colleagues were a reference group enabled us to predict the strength of the contextual variable when a context wasin opposition to an individual's predisposition."

This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France."

Thanks to common foundations in both epistemology and ontology, these two fields can benefit from drawing more explicitly on each other. The process‐theoretic tradition in social theory and contemporary agent‐based models shift theorizing from nomothetic to generative explanations of social forms, and from variable‐based to configurative ontologies. In order to formalize sociational theory, the author focuses on how to model dynamic social networks and emergent actor configurations."

Evidence is presented that such external processes have a significant effect on local rates of delinquency.

No such transition occurred, however. Previous explanations for this are inadequate, because they discount the strength of the Tuscany economy or downplay the presence of these preconditions. To explain the Tuscan outcome, this article draws on sectoral theories (agriculture vs. manufacturing) from the neoclassical and Marxist literature. Since these theories often give the wrong prediction, because they are based on formal attributes of actors, the author combines them with a Weberian conceptualization of substantively specific economic interests."

State primary-homicide rates are found to be related to poverty and to the percentage of the population aged 20-34, while nonprimary homicide rates are significantly related only to the percentage of the state living in urban areas. Replication of the original models demonstrates that the failure to classify homicides in this manner results in the incorrect assessment of the relative size and importance of the various predictors of homicide included in these models."

Market potential has no influence on performance when league authority is opposed by antitrust law, player unions, rival leagues, or league members. To explain this anomaly, authority and market relations must both be seen as embedded within the multiplex relations among team owners. These relations changed dramatically with the rise of national audiences in the past three decades. Inequality among equals replaced inequality among unequals as the support of a rootless national audience replaced rooted and unequal local audiences, altering the opportunity context of owners."

Option pricing theory—a “crown jewel” of neoclassical economics—succeeded empirically not because it discovered preexisting price patterns but because markets changed in ways that made its assumptions more accurate and because the theory was used in arbitrage.

This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

Previous research employing this model with three-wave panel data has considered all respondents who provided even one ""no opinion"" or equivocal response as nonopinion holders and combined this group with the estimated nonattitudes under the model. This results in very high levels of nonattitudes. In this research, an argument is developed for treating the nonsubstantive responses probabilitstically. When the tabulations analyzed include an equivocal response category, the simple black-and-white model no longer fits. An alternative black-gray-white model is proposed that fits the data well.

Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time.

It is, on the other hand, expressive and personal like music. Both forms of communication function in bringing about those understandings between individuals and peoples which are the substance-the warp and woof-of culture. The social function of communication seems to be to bring about and maintain understanding and cultural solidarity among individuals and societies. It may be contrasted with the social function of competition which is to bring about an orderly distribution and a division of labor between individuals and societies. This division of labor, so far as it is brought about by competition, involves the individuation of the competing units. Competition and communication may thus be said to suplement each other, since communication operates as an integrating and socializing principle, while competition is the principles of individuation. More specifically, communication may be said to operate in two dimensions. On the one hand, it serves to bring about a diffusion of cultural traits and so widen the cultural area within which socia relations may exist. On the other hand, communication, in so far as it brings diverse cultural influences into focus at some center of communication, like the rural village or metropolitan city, tends the bring into the common understanding new ideas-ideas that inevitably arise in the ferment, confusion, and conflict of the acculturation process. The processes of diffusion and acculturation seem to take place in the manner and under the conditions in which news is collected and diffused. It is characteristic of news that it circulates as far as its message is understood and seems important. It is probable, however, that the cinema, which circulates not news, but pictures, is more devastating in its effects upon local cultures and in bringing the widely dispersed people of the world within the influence of a single culture of civilization than is the news proper."

The results indicate that measures of membership in different ""fractions"" of the working class are not consistently related to family or school compliance structures as the theory predicts. However, hypotheses concerning the relationship between family compliance structures and school compliance structures, parental attachment, association with delinquent friends, and self-reported delinquent behavior are generally supported. Few differences are observed in separate analyses for males and females. Although the results raise questions about Colvin and Pauly's emphasis on a reconceptualized construct of social class, their incorporation of family and school compliance structures in their causal model is a promising contribution to the development of integrated theories of delinquency."

Models of institutional influence and of within-school processes are developed for both secondary and postsecondary education to integrate and refine the literatures on school effects and returns to schooling. Rather impressive occupational status and earnings differentials are associated with gross school-to-school differences and with qualitative differences in educational experiences within institutions. Secondary school characteristics and experiences weigh particularly upon the market outcomes of youth who terminated formal schooling at high school graduation. We suggest that the traditional use for quantitative indices of schooling (years of school completed or certification levels) in assessing the market consequences of investments in education needs to be supplemented by information on qualitative variations in educational experiences. Additionally, the likelihood that school experiences may have quite different implications for selected target populations deserves further consideration. The simplistic assumption implicit in much of the school-effects literature that institutional effects are homogeneous may actually mask quite important consequences for certain students."

In particular, we examine the post-World War II political-economic experience of the United States, because the military expenditures thesis was most fully developed initially in an attempt to explain postwar American prosperity. We evaluate what we term the ""naive"" model of Baran and Sweezy, which suggests that the degree to which national output is absorbed by military spending should be dependent on aggregate economic conditions such as unemployment. Finding only inconsistent evidence to support the naive view, we incorporate the insights of recent neo-Marxists (especially O'Connor) on the linkages among the monopoly corporate sector, the unionized sector of labor, and the state. The empirical evidence appears consistent with this ""modified"" view, with unemployment in the unionized sector and rate of growth of monopoly profits significantly affecting variation in military expenditures as a percentage of GNP during the postwar period. We then introduce a variety of controls in an attempt to determine if our results are simply statistical artifacts of equation specification, of time dependence, of estimation procedures, or of measurement strategy. Despite a multitude of such checks, we find that our results remain statistically significant and in the predicted direction. We do find, however, that additional economic (i.e., concentration) and political (i.e., the electoral cycle) variables also affect military spending."

While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance."

It is argued that the origins of symbolic motivational patterns are to be found in the social structure of industrial capitalism and the ""culture of competition"" to which it gives rise. But no theory of motivation, however sophisticated, is sufficient to explaint the causes of white-collar crime, and the paper therefore concludes with an analysis of the patterns of opportunities presented to social actors in different structural positions in advanced capitalist nations."

However, when Protestants and Catholics are subdivided by sex and the children-of-immigrants category is confined to people both of whose parents were foreign-born, it is found that (1) Protestants of both sexes show an increasing frequency of church attendance with more generations in the United States; (2) among Catholic men who are children of immigrants church attendance drops; (3) Catholic women show no meaningful changes in church attendance for the various generations. It is thought that these Protestant-Catholic differences stem from the secular orientation of Protestant immigrants."

They argue that socialism was made into a laboratory of economic knowledge during the socialist calculation debate of the 1920s and 1930s. An extensive debate during the Cold War is also documented and shows that a transnational network continued to be organized around attempts to connect the results obtained in the socialist laboratory with debates and struggles in Western economics. Finally, the drafting of transition blueprints in postcommunist Eastern Europe after 1989, with the participation of American economists, is shown to be a continuation of this transnational network."

The outline, to which the first section is an introduction, sketches certain methological developments, in the older divisions of social science, which proved to be antecedents of sociology. In brief, attempts to interpret human experience have advanced from mysticism to criticism, and to differentiated and specialized criticism. The exhibit which is to follow indicates certain gradations in this progress which emerged in sociology. Waymarks of the evolution of sociology are selected chiefly from German methodologists, because their influence upon the generation of American scholars who won academic recognition for the subject is more evident and cumulative than other sequences."

An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task."

The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics."

Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this gypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations paper received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards, did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-ranking scientists. However, lesser quality papers by high-ranking scientists receive greater attention than papers of equal quality by low-ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who to on the greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries."

A study based on hotel directories-a type of source obviously incomplete in its enumeration of hotels-indicates a larger relative number of hotel rooms in leading cities of the Pacific Coast than in the other large cities of the country. Since no definite statistical information is available for the hotel population in general, a special study was made of hotel dwellers in Seattle. This study gave the percentage of occupancy, the weekly and seasonal enables, and the sex and age composition of the population in 437 hotels. There were two and one-half times as many couples without children as couples with children. Characteristics of hotel life.-In the large metropolitan hotel the guest is only a number and is characteristically detached from the place in which he sleeps. In some cases this anonymity and impersonality encourages a restless, lonesome, unhappy state of mind. In other cases it enables an escape from the restraints of more intimate groups, such as the small town or the ghetto. Personality patterns in the hotel environment.-Although a certain formal etiquette-a kind ofmechanical correctness-tends to develop in the better class hotels, the ""mores,""that part of our tradition that is thought to involve the general welfare, tend to break down in the hotel environment. Among the heavy offenders for stealing hotel property are listed ""men and women who in their own communities command respect, but who, on going to a hotel, take a 'moral holiday.'"" The individual who lives continually in hotels tends to become either blase or urbane. The hotel child, for example, is usually overstimulated. The tendency, however, seems to be toward the development of immunity to the influences of the hotel environment, and this accommodation is best described as sophistication or urbanity. Thus the individual may gradually accustom himself to ""living in public, eating in public, and all but sleeping in public."""

Further, three spatial structures influence interlocking: the location of a corporation's headquarters vis‐a`‐vis other corporate headquarters and upper‐class clubs, the territorial distribution of a firm's production facilities, and the spatial configuration of a corporation's ownership relations. This suggests that previous interlock research, which ignores spatial considerations, has been seriously misspecified."

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage."

Data were taken from the 1956, 1958, 1960 and the 1972, 1974, 1976 American voter panel studies conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Results support Converse's black-and-white model of attitude stability which posits the existence of some stable opinion holders and a group of ""nonopinion"" respondents whose positions vary unpredictably over time. Rates of opinion holding in the population were estimated to range from a low of 19% for the utilities and housing item, which was Converse's focus, to an atypical high of 59% for the busing item in the second panel. Models allowing for true score change estimated that the number of true score changers was small. The nonopinion respondents were apparently responsive enough to item content that their aggregated responses reflected the climate of opinion among those whose attitudes were better crystallized. As Converse had concluded, there was relatively little overlap of ""issue publics""-those who held opinions on one issue were not necessarily opinion holders on other questions. There were not consistent differences in education or political involvement between opinion holders and nonopinion respondents. Relationships of education and political involvement to opinion holding suggest that respondents hold stable opinions on those issues that have greatest personal relevance for them."

In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of “fiscal inquisition” weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th‐century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy."

The gentry, being educated, are the logical carriers of Western cultural innovation; but they are noncommercial and see no gain in Westernization. The innovators, in reality, are social outcasts who have lost their traditional status and lead a socially irresponsible life in the treaty ports.

A historically grounded procedure for generating concepts was central to Weber's work. It united explanatory and interpretative analysis within a reflexive framework that responded to the intellectual and political interests of the theorist. Early writings of Parsons and Schutz surmount, in different ways, Weber's strictures on the limits of general theory by eliminating the historical component of Weber's thought.

However, while the literature indicates such a distortion may occur, this has not been demonstrated. Drawing on the data from a national survey, we look at the effect of these three forms of response bias on the pattern of relationships among seven demographic variables (sex, race, education, income, age, marital status, and occupation) and three very different indicators of mental health (psychiatric symptons, self-esteem, and feelings of positive affect). The results lead to an almost unequivocal conclusion: the response bias variables have very little impact on the relationship, and it seems safe to conclude that these sources of response bias do not act in a systematic way to invalidate the pattern of observed relationships between mental health and common demographic variables."

The other is thereby rendered. ""other,"" that is, opaque and irreducible in his individuality. This suspension of the taken-for-granted understanding opens up the possibility of a creative and critical search to understand the other and allows distinguishing among selves.

Experience provides two signs of this correlation in a quantitative sense-differing abilities in storing up words for use and differing abilities in handling quantities of verbal terms at one time. The quantitative limit may be ascertained by tests calling for word reproduction without the stimulus of a running idea. A further test reveals two types of qualitative response in the high-quantity testing group, indicating that differing behavior responses in different individuals may be based on concepts of great differences in clarity but resulting from the same word-stimulus. Difficulty in rapidly summing up relationships between words in the same run of thought creates a difficulty in handling words as symbols of ideas in place. There is a suggestion that these differences are not innate, but result from exposure to differing social environment, which education does not attempt to overcome.

The social-interactionist school of social psychology has countered with a re-emphasis upon the symbolic and communicatory processes and also with a methodological protest against mere mechanical measurement and testing at the expense of sociological interpretation and sympathetic insight. Both schools have contributed toward the growth on an autonomous schience of social psychology."

Regulation of the mechanics of trading in the interest of more efficient functioning has long been carried on by the exchange itself. This type of control has been augmented and improved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any regulation of the exchange which would destroy the principle of the free competitive market, however, would run directly counter to the most important values of contemporary society. Such drastic control would threaten the basic complex of private property and hence would be fundamentally ineffectual."

It appeared as a concerted movement in 1890 and by 1915 had achieved a prodigious growth. It had no church and was essentially a metropolitan religion. Its adherents were impelled mainly by the motive of profit, and few were masters of its theology and metaphysics. Like Puritanism, it recognized the law of prosperity as a cardinal statute. By personal magnetism the adherent could attract, persuade, influence, or control his fellows, and success in business was assured. The writings of New Thought accord with the traditional American philosophy of success. They banish luck and reaffirm the economic potency of character. Faith in equality of opportunity is sustained. The bulk of the literature contains little but esoteric directions for making money. The very novelty of New Though gave it popularity."

Such an elite is seen to profit through the increasing intensification of the land use of the area in which its members hold a common interest. An elite competes with other land-based elites in an effort to have growth-inducing resources invested within its own area as opposed to that of another. Governmental authority, at the local and nonlocal levels, is utilized to assist in achieving this growth at the expense of competing localities. Conditions of community life are largely a consequence of the social, econimic, and political forces embodied in this growth machine. The relevance of growth to the interests of various social groups is examined in this context, particularly with reference to the issue of unemployment. Recent social trends in opposition to growth are described and their potential consequences evaluated."

It represents a case study in isolation and accommodation, and indicates the processes involved in the formation and development of local communities in city life. The natural history of this institution shows that it developed as a gradual and undesigned adaptation to a strage habitat and culture, and its disintegration proceeds independent of legal enactment. The Jews, in so far as they are a separate ethnic group, are a product of ghetto life, which accounts for the reappearance of the ghetto wherever Jews settle in large numbers. The modern ghetto in its location and structure is determined by the unique status of the Jew and by his traditions. His neighbors in the new world tend to be the same as in the old. Eastern ghettos differ from those of the West in that the latter generally have as many local areas of settlement as there are waves of immigrants. As the Jew becomes conscious of his subordinate position in the ghetto he flees, but he is pursued by fellow-Jew until his new habitat assumes the atmosphere of the ghetto itself. In the course of his migration, his personality changes as the culture of his group fuses with that of the larger world outside."

These ecological conditions not only sustained a high rate of movement participation but also facilitated the formation of many ecology–dependent strategies of student mobilization, which in turn patterned the dynamics of the movement."

Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women’s underinvestment in firm‐specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm‐specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high‐skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women’s disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand‐side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in nonformalized labor markets are discussed."

Particularly promising here is ""dual exchange theory,"" as represented in Ekeh's elaboration of Levi-Strauss's conception of elementary exchange. Using data from a small-scale ethnographic study of social network mobilization among low-income black women in the event of job loss, this paper investigates two tenets of dual exchange theory: (1) informal support exchanges in natural settings take the form of ""generalized"" and ""restricted"" exchange, and (2) generalized exchange systems are associated with greater degrees of solidarity and social support. The data support the dual exchange thesis, with some modification of Ekeh's dichotomized conceptualization of exchange.

A schedule was developed containing questions on the home and on social relationships which differentiated the well-adjusted from the maladjusted children. Values were assigned to the various possible answers to the questions and the sum of these values gave two scores for each child, one indicating the type of home background, the other the type of social relationships. The reliability and validity of the scales have been established by approved methods."

Garnier,American Journal of Sociology,91,2,1985-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 250-280,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Through an analysis of a large survey of employment men and women in France, this article shows that French reproduction theory has overstated the role of education in reproducing class advantage from generation to generation. Among men, reproduction of control over labor power (i.e., managerial/supervisory positions) is primarily direct instead of indirect through education. At the same time, education plays no role in reproducing ownership of businesses (i.e., capitalist and petty bourgeois positions), and there is little tendency for capitalist or petty bourgeois fathers to convert their economic capital into the educational capital for their sons so that the sons can secure managerial positions. Education serves less as a reproducer of class advantage than as a vehicle of mobility into managerial positions. Although reproduction theory has tended to ignore gender differences in class reproduction , these are found to be substantial. In the reproduction of ownership, women are less likely than men to inherit a business from their father. In the reproduction of control over labor power, the considerations that are important to men's chances of acquiring managerial/supervisory positions are generally much less important to women's chances. Thus reproduction strategis that are succesful in perpetuating class privilege for men do not work as well for women."

Consequently there are those who regard it as a wholly uscientific procedure. Sometimes they claim that the language of ""motives and goals"" is itself unscientific, but this is a dogmatic and metaphysical limitation of the realm of science. More plausibly they claim that since motives are baffling and unverifiable they lie outside the scope of scientific investigation. But this claim goes too far, since motives manifest themselves in various evidential ways, and science may properly examine the bearing of the evidences, even where certainty is not attainable. The moral is not that we abandon the investigation of motives-for they are intimate data of human experience-but that we make the recognition of difficulties the basis for more thorough investigation."

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change."

Each was previously formalized within a common biased-net mathematical framework. These two formalizations are integrated within a single approach to the study of social relations. Blau's theory is associated with quantities such as heterogeneity, consolidation, and a bias parameter pertaining to homophily. Granovetter's principle is formalized in terms of another bias parameter pertaining to the likelihood of relational closure in triads. A concluding discussion examines empirical literature on diffusion processes to see if hypotheses implied by the unified theory are supported by evidence."

The supervisory styles were arrayed on two continuums: the close versus general and the punitive versus non-punitive. Close as compared with general supervision produced significant increases in aggressive feelings toward the supervisor and in indirect aggression toward the supervisor through lowered productivity, an insignificant increase in verbal aggression toward the supervisor, and an increase of borderline significance in aggressive feelings toward co-workers. Punitive as compared with non-punitive supervision produced significant increases in indirect aggression through lowered productivity and in verbal aggression, but no significant increases in aggression toward co-workers. The relationship between close supervision and aggresive feelings appears to be mediated by the self-esteem of the subordinate; an increase in aggresive feelings occurred only in subjects having low self-esteem. Finally, the combined effect of the close and punitive supervision dimensions, for both aggressive feelings and indirect aggression, was not a simple function, but was less than would be predicted on the basis of additive assumptions."

As the usual static consideration of balance predicts, students recognize and like others who are near them, both in physical distance (proximity) and in college class (peership). Most important, however-if little tested-are the dynamic aspects of balance whose evaluation requires tracing individual pairs through time. Doing this shows that between room-mates and others living near to one another, attraction changes less when it is initially high; between those more distant, attraction changes less when initially low. Thus, for everyone, attraction is more stable. Over the dormitory's first four years, similitary of physical location and of college class continues to predict attraction; but between more proximate persons, prediction declines in later years, as frienships increasingly span distance and class."

Any satisfactory theory must attempt to account for the fact that the repeated administration of opiates sometimes is followed by addition and sometimes is not. The factor which accounts for this differential effect appears to be the person's knowledge or belief, supplied him by his cultural milieu, concerning the nature of the distress that accompanies the sudden cessation of the opiate. If he fails to realize the connection between this distress and the opiate he escapes addiction, whereas if he attributes the discomfort to the opiate and thereafter uses the opiate to alleviate it he invariably becomes addicted. Addiction is generated in the process of using the drug consciously to alleviate withdrawal distress. No exceptions to this theory could be found. It is confirmed by analysis of certain aspects of addict argot and by the consideration of certain types of crucial cases. The theory provides a simple means of accounting for many aspects of the habit. It is methodologically significant in that it is based upon case data and is at the same time universal in form and subject to definite verification or disproof."

Data on the occurrence of conflicts and of violence against various ethnic or racial groups in the 81 largest cities, 1880-1914, show that the growth of the union movement and the rising supply of low-wage labor increased levels of ethnic competition in urban labor markets, thus raising rates of ethnic comflict. The findings support the argument that ethnic conflict and labor unrest are parallel forms of collective action and that each depends on the number and foundings of national labor unions. The effect of labor union organization is strongest for all attacks on blacks. In addition, sharp increases in immigration, a downturn in economic fortunes, and contagion processes all raise rates of ethnic conflict."

In particular, we discuss (a) embeddability, or how to determine whether observations on an empirical process could have arisen via the evolution of a continuous-time Markov structure; and (b) identification, or what to do if the observations are consisten with more than one continuous-time Markov structure. With respect to the latter topic, we discuss how to select the specific structure from the list of alternatives which should be associated with the empirical process. We point out that the issues of embeddability and identification are especially pertinent to modeling empirical processes when one has available only fragmentary data and when the observations contain ""noise"" or other sources of error. These characteristics, of course, describe the typical work situation of sociologists. Finally, we note the type of situation in which a continuous-time model is the proper structure to employ and indicate that issues analogus to the ones we describe here apply to modeling social processes with discrete-time structure."

Since urban and rural areas differ in the distribution of private and public places, with denser public places in cities, police practice in urban and rural areas is different. And crimes of different types are systematically distributed; some, like murder, are almost entirely committed in private places, and others, such as traffic offenses, entirely in public. Statistics on arrest and conviction rates for different types of crime show the influence of the social location of the types of crime on the differential character of police practice. Too, the structural characteristics of subsections of police departments are derived from the social location of the type of crime the subsection deals with. Hypotheses on the effects of introducing new crimes into the responsibilities of different subsections of police department are outlined for future research."

The findings indicate that workplace conditions, including size, composition, and minority management, affect workers’ charges as well as verified claims; the latter are also affected by institutional factors, such as affirmative action requirements, subsidiary status, and industrial sector. These results suggest that internal workplace conditions affect both workers’ and regulatory agents’ interpretations of potentially discriminatory experiences, while institutional conditions matter only for regulatory agents’ interpretations of those events."

Major criticisms of the approach are considered, and several levels of analysis on which the reactions emphasis is useful are outlined. Brief consideration is given to some of the theoretical antecedents of the reactions orientation-leading to the conclusion that, at its heart, the approach simply develops, applies, and organizes some central themes of general sociological analysis as they relate to deviance and social control. While the approach probably does not constitute a causal theory in the strict sense of the term, its strong grounding in traditional sociological perspectives suggests that it has great promise in advancing theoretical integration in the area of deviance analysis."

Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict."

A negatively skewed curve is probably normal for distribution of marital satisfaction, but this skewness is exaggerated in the present study by the instrument used and by psychological selective factors. The Appendix suggests that a periodic relationship may obtain between number of years' duration of marriage and marital satisfaction; that a parabolic relationship exists between the difference in age of the spouses and marital satisfaction; that a negative relationship may exist between age of men at marriage and their marital satisfaction; and that the first child is more of a disturbing factor with men than the second child."

Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the globalization of bankruptcy law has proceeded through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law."

By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms through which other theoretical or empirical constructs—such as racism or late modernity—operate; and open a window into the ways in which people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its own right."

A mesolevel network is a social network that differs in three important respects from interpersonal microlevel networks directly linking prior and potential adopters of a practice to one another: (1) it is generated by a different causal process than the microlevel network; (2) it tends to be much sparser than the microlevel network; and (3) the typical edge of a mesolevel network bridges much longer sociometric and geographic distances than the typical edge of a microlevel network. These types of mesolevel networks are important because they can dramatically influence the speed at which a contagious practice will diffuse. The mesolevel network focused upon in this article is the network that emerged out of the travel routes of political agitators affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. Computational modeling shows that the diffusion of the Social Democratic Party is likely to have been considerably influenced by the structure of this network. Empirical analyses of the founding of party organizations during the period 1894–1911 support these theoretical predictions and suggest that this mesolevel network was of considerable importance for the diffusion of the Swedish Social Democratic Party."

It points to the special factors which have not only canceled the negative effect of holding statuses of low rank, but which have produced a positive and facilitating context for career. Among these are the models in the black community of women as ""doers""; the support of extended kin in assisting women with family responsibilities; pressure on black women to be economically productive and financially independent; and a number of other conditions leading to self-confidence and autonomy."

In this article, we show that adolescent males who are opposite‐sex twins are twice as likely as expected to report same‐sex attraction; and that the pattern of concordance (similarity across pairs) of same‐sex preference for sibling pairs does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context. Our data falsify the hormone transfer hypothesis by isolating a single condition that eliminates the opposite‐sex twin effect we observe—the presence of an older same‐sex sibling. We also consider and reject a speculative evolutionary theory that rests on observing birth‐order effects on same‐sex orientation. In contrast, our results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same‐sex romantic preferences."

The study’s key theoretical insight is that the organizational decoupling required for successful commercialization may complicate companies’ ability to gain employee acceptance. Rich ethnographic data from Motherhood, Inc., an organization offering support and services for new mothers, is leveraged to identify two conditions under which employee resistance may arise and undermine successful commercialization. This article contributes to sociological understandings by theorizing the important role of employees in commercialization and to organizational theory more generally by specifying conditions under which decoupling may be difficult to achieve."

Most of the evidence, however, is hidden because sociologists generally (1) fail to differentiate kinds of theoretical activity, (2) focus almost exclusively on growth by means of increasing empirical support, and (3) ignore the variety of theoretical contexts within which growth can occur. Distinguishing among orienting strategies (i.e., metatheoretical frameworks), unit theories (individual theoretical arguments), and theoretical research programs (sets of interrelated theories) helps overcome these obstacles. A focus on programs reveals five types of relations among theories. Three types represent basic forms of theoretical growth; the other two are more specialized forms which usually emerge only in the context of programs based on one of the three basic types. These ideas are first explicated and then applied to several cases of ongoing theoretical activity in sociology. Such cases provide models or exemplars (in the Kuhnian sense) of theoretical growth. Detailed analysis of these exemplars should promote significant growth in other branches of sociology."

The impression of two kinds of neuroses-symptom neuroses and character neuroses-which resulted from this new conception is again misleading, for every neurosis is essentially a character disorder. This view introduces social viewpoints into a field claimed by medical psychiatry. From a social standpoint a neurosis can be defined as a deviation from the ""normal"" in the sense of the statistically average in a given culture. From a clinical viewpoint neuroses may be regarded as an attempt to cope with life under difficult internal conditions which center about a basic anxiety toward life in general. An attempt to bridge the difference between the socially oriented definition of neurosis and that which is clinically oriented would describe a neurosis as a deviation from the average but add that the deviation does not primarily concern the manifest behavior but the quantity or quality of basic anxiety as well as that of the deviation developed for the sake of security."

The bases of racial classification have been numerous, and agreement as to the meaning of ""race"" is prominent only by its absence. Brain morphology and pigmentation are the most popular criteria of racial differentiation, but neither of these seems to be dependable. The monogenetic origin of races is commonly held by anthropologists. If this be true, it is migration, regional segregation, and environmental selection that explain anatomical, physiological, and pathological peculiarities of ""racial"" groups. But, in the last analysis, race differences are defensible only in a certain special sense. For the hybridization of races is an acknowledged fact. Racial differences turn out to be cultural differences, and these-in view of the constant re-adaptation of borrowed culture forms to the specific demands of pre-existing cultures-are anything but pure. Competition and migration, mobility and dominance, segregation and selection may be regarded as stages in the development of culture groups. In the light of this analysis the concept of racial superiority appears to be highly artificial. The real significance of the term ""race"" lies in its employment as a culture symbol of group conflict and group organization."

Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit‐based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace."

Hutchins' thesis that since theology cannot furnish a unifying principle for modern education, metaphysics should be employed for this purpose. Both parties to the debate agree on the need, and agree that the only question here is which of these two disciplines should supply it. Both refer to conditions in the Middle Ages as in some sense an ideal and a model. This review points out that in so far as there was unity of belief in the Middle Ages it rested on some direct compulsion with more of compulsive conditioning and still more general ignorance, which also was partly imposed, but was chiefly due to the limitations of the culture as a whole. It is argued that history and common sense unite in proving that ""theology"" must claim the right to control men's thinking coercively, and must do so as far as it can find effective means. The first step in unifying anything else by means of theology or metaphysics must be to unify the doctrinal field in question itself. From this point of view the difference between the two fields disappears; unity means the imposition of some particular theology by force. The ideal of social thought and education unified in terms of philosophical principles universally accepted is admittely appealing, intellectually and aesthetically. But the history of Christendom since the Middle Ages seems to prove two things: (1) that it is impossible to have agreement on theology (or metaphysics) without coercion, and probably impossible with it; (2) that is unnecessary to have such agreement in order to have social co-operation both more humane and far more effective than any ever seen under any system or social order based on official control of thinking. This is true in spite of the fact that freedom seems to involve much difference of opinion about ultimate questions, which is in a sense ""disorderly."" In conclusion, it is suggested that the only means to intellectual unity which is either possible or morally defensible in the discovery and dispassionate promulgation of ""truth,"" the ""right"" answers to the questions at issue."

When trying to explain the causes of these behaviors, however, many social scientists typically resort to the idea of ""pathological"" origins. On the whole, social scientists have yet to explain how and why ""normal"" individuals operating in unexceptional social environments deviate and commit crimes, Recent developments in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology provide new insights that promise to explain how deviance and crime arise naturally in populations of interacting individuals without necessarily implying genetic influences. We interpret criminal behaviors by which offenders expropriate goods or services from others as expressions of diverse behavioral strategies that derive from normal patterns of population-level social organization and interaction. This views accommodates both explanations that focus on individual causes of crime and those directed toward social factors. Our approach permits the generation of novel hypotheses and fully accommodates, simplifies, and helps unify important and diverse insights and findings amassed by a wide range of disciplines and theories that have tried to account for the nature and distribution of crime."

The characteristics of neighborhood organizations in Seattle, Washington, in 1929 and in 1979 are compared, focusing on the neighborhood level and taking an institutional approach. Two sets of hypotheses about the organizations-the first dealing with changes in resident participation and the second with changes in functional orientation-are derived from the natural-and limited-community models. In general, the analysis provides mixed support for the hypotheses. The data indicate a clear trend toward a more exclusively political emphasis among Seattle neighborhoods but cast doubt on the simple ""gemeinschaft"" characterization of these areas at an earlier point in time. A major conclusion of the study is that, if the decline-of-community thesis is to give an accurate description of the transformation in urban neighborhood life during the past half-century, the natural-community model should be revised."

The authors find that the assortment of interpersonal moves associated with a sense of connection characterizes a conventionalized form of initial courtship activity. The game is successfully played when females are the point of focus and engaged in the conversation and males demonstrate alignment with and understanding of the female.

Speaking in terms of collectivity is alluring; but it is description, not explanation. Social organism metaphors, group-mind theories, and the like never lead beyond themselves, nor serve to reveal causation. The group fallacy defined.-This fallacy consists in substituting the group for the individual as a principle of explanation. The group concept may be phrased in either psychological or ""purely social"" terms. Illustrations are drawn from the following fields. I. Social conflict. Freudian repression and dissociation are terms applicable only to individuals. There is a wide divergence of meaning between mental conflict and social conflict. 2. Revolution. Here the fallacy is expressed in such group terms as immobility of society and breakdown of ""social habits."" These terms are merely descriptive, drawing attention away from the truly causal behavior of individuals. 3. The theory of the super-organic. The concept of a causal science on a purely social (non-psychological) plane is untenable, because in all science explanation is possible only by drawing upon the concepts of sciences at more elementary levels. In practice also no one has succeeded in formulating a science of this sort. Culture history is not culture explanation; much less is it an adequate explanation of social change. The true basis for sociology is the social behavior of he socialized individual, in other words, social psychology. The Work of sociology is to describe collectivities of social behavior and social change resulting from it in terms of the group, and to explain these phenomena in terms of the individual."

More recent research indicates that Israeli teachers tend to generalize the characteristics of ethnic origin so that Orientals are considered less capable intellectually and motivationally to such an extent that their handicaps are irreversible. Using the framework of expectation-states theory, this study proposes that these prevailing tendencies are an inevitable consequence of the functioning of ethnicity as a diffuse status. This interpretation suggest that ethnic prejudice in Israel is a relatively general phenomenon, not limited to the schooling process. The proposition is examined in the context of achievement in professional soccer, where intellectual prerequisites are less demanding. The findings support the proposition, showing similar patterns of ethnic inequality in terms of both actual achievement and the operation of status generalization. The Israeli case suggests that an egalitarian ideology and policies of ethnic integration cannot effectively prevent emerging inequalities so long as ethnicity functions as a diffuse status."

This thesis challenges those theories which claim that the importance of class conflicts declined under state socialism and that therefore such societies should be described as containing nonantagonistic classes or strata. It also challenges the critical theories which acknowledge the existence of a new dominant class in Eastern Europe, but which describe that class as the bureaucracy or technobureaucracy. This paper attempts to base its class analysis on the exploration of the mechanisms and institutions of expropriation of surplus under state socialism. It is suggested that in contemporary Eastern Europe private ownership and market mechanisms of expropriation have been replaced by central planning and redistribution of the economic surplus. All those who have vested interests in the maximization of redistributive power are members of a new dominating class. If we define the new class this way it will include more than just the bureaucracy; potentially, it includes the whole intelligentsia. The paper describes the new dominant class of intelligentsia as a class in statu nascendi. The formation of this class takes a whole historical epoch. In the first stage of state-socialist development the Djilas thesis is basically accurate: under Stalinism and in the early post-Stalinist years the bureaucracy had the monopoly of power. During the last two decades, on the other hand, the social base of power holders has broadened, especially in those countries which experimented with economic and political reforms. The formation of a new dominant class which incorporates the whole of the intelligentsia is now under way."

But the college-related protests and the wider public disechantment have sharply different characteristics: they have peaked at different points in the war; they are discontinous in educational and age basis; and a substantial part of the antiwar public is also extremely hostile toward college protesters. Together these findings suggest a distinction between moral criticisms of the goals and nature of the war and pragmatic disillusionment over failure to win it. This hypothesized distinction is investigated using thematic analysis of open-ended responses from a cross-section sample of 1,263 Detroit adults who had indicated opposition to American intervention in Vietnam. A small classroom sample of University of Michigan students is also used for comparison purposes. The themes emphasized by the Detroit sample as a whole, and by most subcategories defined in terms of race, sex, age, and education, are generally consistent with the moral-pragmatic distinction. Other related factors (such as traditional isolationism) are also shown to contribute to broader public disenchantment with the war. The moral-pragmatic distinction, while somewhat oversimplified, is useful in considering public reactions to future wars of the same general type."

It is argued that social exchange produces positive or negative global feelings, which are internally rewarding or punishing. The theory indicates that social units (relations, groups, networks) are perceived as a source of these feelings, contingent on the degree of jointness in the exchange task. The jointness of the task is greatest if (1) actors find it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on or contributions to solving the exchange task (nonseparability) and (2) actors perceive a shared responsibility for success or failure at the exchange task. The theory explicates the effects of different exchange structures on these conditions and, in turn, on cohesion and solidarity. Implications are developed for network‐to‐group transformations."

The most prominent types are those showing radicalism with high scholarship and low prejudice, and conservatism with low scholarship and high prejudice. Those who feel strongly on political matters, the Catholics, the Jews, and those who differ in vote from their fathers also show distinctive political and personal qualities. The study discovers the hierarchy of prejudice for the group as a whole; the leading bias is antisocialistic. Several practical conclusions for politics are offered. The principal theoretical conclusion is that political behavior is not specific, but is related to inclusive sets or attitudes in personality. The political character of men is, on the whole, bound up with many generic traits in their personalities."

At the basis of whatever cultural uniqueness the South has is the institution of the plantation. From the point of view of the educational process, plantation societies may be compared with agricultural mission societies. The plantation and the agricultural mission have different histories and conflicting ideologies, but they developed in similar environments; and in adjusting to the permanent elements in the environment, like geography and climate, they eventually become very similar institutions. The educational process in each goes about as far as,and not much further than, the needs of the situation require. And the needs are, or have been, about the same. The comparison suggest that education is fundamentally a process of biological adaptation and survival. But an education which has sufficied for relatively simple world in which both the plantation and the mission developed will not suffice for competition in the more complex and uncertain order into which the world is moving."

The permanence of civilization depends on man's understanding of, and co-operation with, the totality of the region's forces. The law of diminishing returns is part of a wider law of the exhaustion of the store of nature when man destroys the established cycle of the region's life-processes. Where man has torn the web of life nature seeks to repair it through a reduction of the population to numbers that the ecologic balance may permit. Many countries have adopted a standard of consumption with little reference to the resources. Science must comprehend the web of relations between human life and organic and inorganic nature and reveal the relation between cause and effect between man's activities and the remote phases of transformation in nature's life processes."

It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965–99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions."

Census data, police records, and an independent survey of more than 3,500 residents are then integrated to test a theory of collective efficacy and structural constraints. Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after controlling neighborhood structural characteristics. Collective efficacy is also linked to lower rates of violent crime after accounting for disorder and the reciprocal effects of violence.

Umberto Eco's idea of a semantic encyclopedia is used as the basis of an illustration which is set forth in contrast to a formalist (Blau) and an interpretativist (Bittner/Garfinkel) theory of social structures.

The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition.

The author analyzes the effects of hierarchical (superior‐subordinate) and horizontal (friendship and co‐working) networks on “participation shifts”—transitions in the identities of speakers and targets (addressees) that occur from one speaking turn to the next—in meetings of 10 groups of managers. The results point to a range of relational obligations and entitlements, such as the obligation subordinates have to bolster superiors’ control of the floor, and the way in which friendship and co‐working ties get expressed through remarks made to third parties. The article is perhaps the first to link statistically network‐analytic and conversation‐analytic levels of analysis."

Lasswell,American Journal of Sociology,45,3,1939-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 375-390,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The most abiding contribution of Freud to social science is the observational standpoint which he invented. The psychoanalytic standpoint is intesive rather than extensive, scientific and therapeutic rather than indoctrinating. It is an interview rather than a participant, spectator, or collector relationship; and it is an insight interview. The criteria of insight are formulated, and the point is made that simultaneous insight into the person, personality, and culture is obtained. From this standpoint the insight interview is a means of acquiring skill in the discovery of culture and hence important for social scientists who are mainly concerned with culture. The psychoanalytic standpoint has prompted the use of more intensive methods in social observation; psychoanalytic hypotheses and findings have stimulated research. The rich yield of intensive investigation has called for more refined definitions of basic terms like ""trait,"" ""reaction,"" ""person,"" ""personality,"" ""conduct,"" ""behavior,"" and ""culture"" and has posed the task of calibrating the observations made from one standpoint with observations made in any other position along the continuum of intensiveness-extensiveness."

Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work."

Conflict makes for a total functionalizing of thought which is interpreted only in terms of its alleged social, economic, political, or psychological sources and functions. Deepened social conflict today renews the relevance of an old problem in the sociology of knowledge: socially patterned differentials in access to new knowledge. As groups and collectivities become more self-conscious and solidary under conditions of social polarization, their members tend to claim unique or privileged access to certain kinds of knowledge. This can be described as the doctrine of the Insider, which includes the correlative claim that the Outsider has a structurally imposed incapacity for access to such knowledge. Outsider doctrine involves complementary claims of access to knowledge grounded on the assumption of socially based detachment. The rationale of the Insider doctrine is examined, with special references to the advocates of a ""black social science,"" a case taken as prototypical for other Insider doctrines based on sex, age, religion, nationality, etc. Structural analysis in terms of status sets indicates that Insider and Outsider doctrines based on affiliation with a single collectivity or occupancy of a single status are necessarily unstable and inadequate. The paper concludes by examining the distinctive interactive roles of Insiders and Outsiders that involve interchange, tradeoffs, and syntheses in the formation of social knowledge."

The socially shared presuppositions they brought to their reading caused West Indian reviewers to interpret Lamming's novels as involving questions of personal and national identity, British reviewers to concentrate on the novels' language and literary qualities, and American reviewers to emphasize race. Each of Lamming's novels exercises a different degree of ""cultural power,"" and this capacity to engender multiple meanings while retaining coherence shows that cultural meanings emerge from the interaction between cultural works of varying power and human recipients of varying expectations and concerns. In turn, this interaction suggests a theory of metaphor that enables research in the sociology of culture to utilize both cultural and sociological data without reducing one to the other."

Moreover, these benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the friendship‐network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved if a manager’s competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors."

By taking the role of the generalized other, individual can assess the meaning of their impulses and actions. When individuals observe themselves frequently or persistently breaking ""residual rules,"" they attribute disturbance to themselves and may seek professional help. Drawing from Hochschild and Pugliesi, the article reconceptualized "" residual rule-breaking"" as violations of feeling or expression norms. When individuals are unable to manage or transform deviant feelings, self-attributions of disturbance should result. The conditions under which feeling management attempts are likely to fail and result in self-attributions of disturbance are outlined in the context of a more general theory of emotional processes. Some conditions under which labeling by others may occur are also identified, using the same theoretical approach."

Both assumptions are here questioned. Operational definitions, in common with any other method of increasing the precision of the meaning of a concept, undoubtedly frequently limit that meaning and so exclude some meanings which were previously attached to the term. It does not follow that the meanings so excluded are denied or debarred from study. These neglected aspects are themselves subject to precise and operational definition. Various other misunderstandings of the operational and positivistic position are discussed. The hypothesis is advanced that in sociology, as in other natural sciences, some of the opposition to the positivistic approach may be due to its apparent lack in aesthetic and literary qualities to minds conditioned by the scientific philosophy of the nineteenth century. A series of specific questions is propounded in the hope of clarifying the issues under consideration."

Socialization effects of family roles on marijuana use are reflected in the reduced risk of marijuana initiation after marriage among women and the increased rate of stopping marijuana use after marriage among women and after parenthood among men.

Above all, Nisbet's charge that the new evolutionism is based on metaphor and analogy ignores entirely the increasingly substantial empirical grounding to theory in archaeological, historical, and socilogical research. Also, his effort to force scholars to choose between the nomothetic concerns of evolutionists and the idiographic concerns of historians and some historical sociologist invites conflict where cooperation is needed."

The claim to face may rest on the basis of status, whether ascribed or achieved, and on personal or nonpersonal factors; it may also vary according to the group with which a person is interacting. Basic differences are found between the processes involved in gaining versus losing face. While it is not a necessity for one to strive to gain face, losing face is a serious matter which will, in varying degrees, affect one's ability to function effectively in society. Face is lost when the individual, either through his action or that of people closely related to him, fails to meet essential requirements placed upon him by virtue of the social position he occupies. In contrast to the ideology of individualism, the question of face frequently arises beyond the realm of individual responsibility and subjective volition. Reciprocity is inherent in face behavior, wherein a mutually restrictive, even coercive, power is exerted upon each member of the social network. It is argued that face behavior is universal and that face should be utilized as a construct of central importance in the social sciences."

At the same time, their presentist orientation toward sociology's past has prevented a direct examination of the utilitarians in their own right. This paper rejects that orientation and investigates the social theory of the major utilitarians. David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. No alleged characteristic of utilitarianism-from the atomistic, rationalistic model of social action to the failure to solve the problem of order-adduced in the traditional attack upon it is actually found in the work of the utilitarians. The paper then outlines the historical process whereby the prevailing mythology concerning utilitarianism developed. The hallmark of that process is not the cumulative development of social theories but the displacement, in changing cultural and social circumstances, of the concerns of utilitarian social theory-a displacement succesively evident in the work of Spencer, early American social scintists, and Park and climaxing in Parson's The Structure of Social Action. The paper concludes by offering a sociological interpretation of Parson's selective account of utilitarian social theory and by identifying the constricting, but still pervasive, theoretical implications of that account."

The sizable immigrant population sharpens intergroup boundaries through the indirect effects of nativism and by contributing to the continuing significance of race in the lives of later‐generation Mexican Americans. The presence of a large immigrant population also creates intragroup boundaries that run through the Mexican‐origin population and that are animated by expectations about ethnic authenticity.

Consequently, these interpreters have critized positions that are attributed to Mead but which he did not propose. The social behaviorist interpretation of the ""I"" is more consistent with the textual evidence. By extending and slightly reformulating Mead's theory, the latter part of the paper aims to show that the social behaviorist interpretation is also more theoretically fertile and methodologically applicable."

The fields of art and science were considered essentially antithetical in methodology as well as in practice. Art was the product of the intuition of the privileged man, and science of the disciplined reason which almost anyone could exercise. Although the ""great man theory"" of art still lingers, there is evidence of an interest in the social analysis of aesthetic culture. Aesthetic culture has been variously conceived as a ""social luxury,"" as a reflection of its age, as an autonomous experience, as an escape from personal disorganization. From the critique of these theories it is apparent that beauty is a folkway that is buttressed by rationalizations that are linked to certain circumstances. It is almost more plausible to state that the theory of art is socially conditioned that that art itself is so determined."

Since lottery tickets are assets with negative expected return, lottery play challenges the basic assumptions of economic theory. This article approaches lottery play from a networks perspective and focuses on syndicate play. A comparison of the development of lottery markets in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Portugal from the 17th century onward shows that lottery play declined with rising incomes except in countries in which syndicate play diffused widely, namely, Spain, and to a lesser extent, Portugal. Although syndicating originated among the relatively poor as a response to an increase in lottery prices, it persisted even when individual play became affordable. This article contends that syndicating endured because of an institutionalization process by which lottery tickets have transformed from purely economic assets into symbolic carriers of interpersonal ties that convey membership and status position in relevant social networks."

Simon's unmeasurable averages are operationalized as the marginals in the 2 X 2 table and can be found directly from two coupled equations in the marginals, if the rate parameters satisfy certain constraints.

The study reported here, based on a vignette experiment (with a design that varies patient status with the nature of behavior), challenges this conclusion. Like previous research, it indicates that a simple assessment of labelings shows little effect on a social distance scale. However, when a measure of perceived dangerousness of mental patients is introduced, strong labeling effects emerge. Specifically, the data reveal that the lable of ""previous hospitalization"" fosters high social distance among those who perceive mental patients to be dangerous and low social distance among those who do not see patients as a threat. It appears that past investigators have missed these effects because they have averaged excessively lenient responses with excessively rejecting ones. This suggests that labels play an important role in how former mental patients are perceived and that labeling theory should not be dismissed as a framework for understanding social factors in mental illness."

The authors argue that network positions that afford independence and control over social resources are consistent with traditional masculine roles and may therefore affect men's sexual performance. For example, when a heterosexual man's female partner has more frequent contact with his confidants than he does—which the authors refer to as partner betweenness—his relational autonomy, privacy, and control are constrained. Analyses of data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) show that about a quarter of men experience partner betweennessa and that these men are 92% more likely to report erectile dysfunction. Partner betweenness is strongest among the youngest men in the sample, which may reflect changing conceptions of masculinity in later life.

Schmitt AND Richard Herman,American Journal of Sociology,79,3,1973-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 566-588,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"This research parallels a previous investigation of the authors of pre-industrial American family pattern during the 1741-91 period. The present investigation involves a content analysis of colonial magazines for 1794-1825. Special attention is given to power patterns, types of attitudes between the sexes, actions toward premarital and extramarital sex involvement, and motivations for entering the marital relationship. The results concerning overt power among male and females that could be subjected to statistical examination in both studies exhibited an almost identical pattern. There was evidence of general existent and advocated overt male power, although such male power was mediated by other forms of female power as follows: there was evidence of existent overt female power and subtle female power in both courtship and the home. There was also evidence of advocated mutual cooperation between the sexes and extended role activities of the female. This latter trend in the direction of status and power of the women in the 1974-1825 period shows a general change over the period of the earlier study. The evidence regarding romantic love in the fictional material occurred to a greater extent than in our first study. The nonfictional discussions of romatic love and motivations were noticeably less frequent in this study than in the prior study. There were very few director or direct discussions of sexual standards. This contrasts with the results of our previous study. It is suggested that the family during the period 1794-1825 was influenced by ongoing internal structural changes, the consequences of the conditions of settlement in America, and humanistic and ideological beliefs which had their roots both in Europe and America. These influences are explored along with their implications for the analysis of changing family structures in historic perspective."

Current approaches to this problem draw on Émile Durkheim and emphasize the way commemorative objects celebrate society's former glories. This article on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial deals with the way society assimilates past events that are less than glorious and whose memory induces controversy instead of consensus. The Vietnam War differed from other wars because it was politically controversial and morally questionable and resulted in defeat; it resembled other wars because it called out in participants the traditional virtues of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. The task of representing these contrasting aspects of the war in a single monument was framed by the tension between contrasting memorial genres. Focusing on the discursive field out of which the Vietnam Veterans Memorial emerged, this analysis shows how opposing social constituencies articulated the ambivalence attending memories of the Vietnam War. Ambivalence was expressed not only in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial's design but also in the design of Vietnam War monuments later erected throughout the United States. These efforts to memorialize a divisive war, along with attempts in other nations to come to terms with the difficulties of their past, call into question Durkheim's belief that moral unity is the ultimate object of commemoration. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and devices like it come into view not as symbols of solidarity but as structures that render more explicit, and more comprehensible, a nation's conflicting conceptions of itself and its past."

A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically."

More recent field work throws new light on the ancient controversies and suggests that a revision is in order both in terminology and in thinking if objectivity and realism are to be preserved.

Within a few moments, the highly integrated collectivity that has dominated its individual members (prejump phase) changes drastically into a tenuous, anomic social situation that gives rise to a very egocentric individuality followed by a return to the former state (postjump phase). This bipolarity of parachuting provides a rare opportunity to study a nearly ideal-typical manifestation of extreme opposite social forms contained within a organizational setting. The sequence of the three phases of the jump, and the dialectical relationship among them, is analyzed here in terms of personal regression leading to social regression, and vice versa. The ambivalence of these relatioships becomes evident in the functional analysis of parachuting's radical implications for individuals as well as for the group and the larger (military) organization."

However, emergence has also been invoked by methodological individualists; they accept the existence of emergent social properties yet claim that such properties can be reduced to explanations in terms of individuals and their relationships. Thus, contemporary sociological uses of emergence are contradictory and unstable. This article clarifies this situation by developing an account of emergence based in contemporary philosophy of mind. The philosophical account is used to evaluate contradictory sociological theories. Several unresolved issues facing theories of emergence in sociology are identified."

Closer and more fruitful relationships between theories of industrialized behavior and theories of collective behavior depend in part on the development of a social-level onception of collective behavior. To this end the two forms of social organization are contrated along the dimensions of social norms and social relationships. On these dimensions, a definition and a typology of collective behavior are suggested."

But investigation shows that the social group, whether represented by the family, the institution, or by other social clusters, is, like the individual, equally resistant to all approach and for the same reason, namely, that personal systematization and self-envelopment have automatically rendered them inaccessible to any view that is not in accord with the private view maintained by them. It is important, therefore, to secure conditions favorable to an analysis of our institutional prejudices if we are not to give warrant to these spurious formations within the tissue of our social organism.

A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach."

Such societal concepts as folkways, mores, and fashions are vague and obscure and leas to confusion and inaccuracy. Specific questions essential to clear understanding of conformity are whether uniformity and conformity exist in the behavior of individuals under observation, in what respect people conform, to what degree, what proportion of the individuals conform, the nature of ""conformity-producing agents,"" etc. The J-curve hypothesis of conformity rests upon the following conceptual basis. Instead of regarding conformity in the dichotomous ""all-or-none"" manner, the approach here suggested is one more consistent with general scientific procedure, namely, to measure degrees of conformity on a continuum. In this context continua are classified under two types, empirical and nonempirical, and the latter is subdivided into a personality continuum and a telic continuum (measuring purpose fulfilment). A ""field of conformity"" is defined when there is a generally accepted, though not necessarily explicitly stated, rule and purpose in the situation, and when 50 per cent or more of the population fall upon the first step of a telic (conformity) continuum whose variable is degrees of fulfilment of this rule and purpose. The two major formulations of the J-curve hypothesis are: (1) the distribution of degrees of conformity upon their appropriate continuum is in the form of a curve of positive acceleration toward the mode and (2) in any conformity field the distribution of measurable variations of the behavior upon a relevant empirical, or nontelic, continuum is in the form of a steep unimodal,double J-curve, in which the mode is likely to be off center and the slopes are likely to be asymmetrical."

Results from a maximum-likelihood probit model that uses data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey indicate that couples' orientation to the ""provider role"" shapes how they respond to job opportunities. A husband's potential loss from a move appears to deter wives from capitalizing on opportunities at a new location, but a wife's potential loss does not deter husbands. However, differences by gender are substantially smaller among men and women who reject traditional notions about husbands'and wives' roles within families.

These findings suggest that, in the contemporary United States, microlevel racial fluidity serves to reinforce existing disparities by redefining successful or high-status people as white (or not black) and unsuccessful or low-status people as black (or not white). Thus, racial differences are both an input and an output in stratification processes; this relationship has implications for theorizing and measuring race in research, as well as for crafting policies that attempt to address racialized inequality."

A sample of 2, 544 high-school studentss was given a standard intelligence test in 1922-23. In 1935 residential data were obtained and the former students were classified as rural and urban. The urban group was in turn divided into four classes according to city size. The urban migrants were found to be superior as measured by the test scores, and their superiority was greatest in cities of metropolitan class. Out-of-state migrants excelled the group remaining in Kansas. The results indicate that the urban environment is exerting a stronger pull upon the abler rural inhabitants of the state, though this selection does not necesarily have any genetic significance."

Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003–7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do “women’s work” in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes.

The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies."

Population concentration produces a diversityof subcultures, strengthens them, and fosters diffusion among them. Together, these three mediating variables account for urban unconventionality.

Origin of the idea of progress. It arose in Greek thought from the changes and processes in nature and life. But the notion of regress was opposed to it These conflicting views result from the different types of minds. 2. Brief historical survey. The views of progress and regress are traced in Greek and Roman thought, throught early Christianity and the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the eighteenth century. The theory of evolution in the nineteenth century made progress a necessary law of nature and gave the doctrine its first conscious scientific form. But criticism shows that it fails like its predecessors. 3. Possibilities and limitations of progress. Only in Psychical nature of man has there been real progress. Intellectual, aesthetic, and ethical progress have been unquestionable. Every science and art have been advanced. 4. The actual progress of human intelligence. This is seen in the improved art of living mechanical inventions, and division of labor. But industrial evolution has brought with it new dangers. Material progress does not necessarily better man's own nature. 5. True progress concerns man himself. Aesthetic betterment is desirable and possible. But the ethical problem is the supreme difficulty. Morality rests in freedom and can be brought under control only by the individual himself. Intelligence simply, magnifies the power for good or evil. Man is both better and worse than ever before. The rationalizing of life is the only road to true progress. 6. Social progress. Forms of government are merely conditions of social opportunity. The Versailles Treaty was a step backward. The United States is drifting on uncharted seas. But civilization is in no danger of relapse. The printing-press has built a storehouse for knowledge that precludes a recrudescence of the Dark Ages. Man has advanced along the lines of his desires and finds happiness in their realization. The whole history of science and philosophy is on the record of a ceaseless progress."

The logical unites the action with the end in view, both subjectively and objectively. All other actions are non-logical. Non-logical actions may have no logical end, only a subjectively logical end, only an objectively logical end, or a subjectively and objectively logical end, though the end does not correspond with the purpose. In human societies non-logical actions are more numerous and more important, but students of social phenomena have disregarded them because of the preconceptions in their own minds. Pareto makes a distinction between truth as experimental science conceives it, and social utility. Another distinction is that between residues, a constant, instinctive part of social phenomena, and derivations, a deductive part that aims to explain, justify, and demonstrate the first. The main classes of the residues are: combination-residues, which compel men to innovate; persistence of aggregates, residues which compel men to conserve; those which compel men to express their sentiments by means of outward acts; those which make a man a social being; the residues of the integrity of the individual; and sexual residues. In one's effort to give logical derivations and demonstrate the universality of his theory he arrives at derivatives. Derivations may appeal to authority, tradition, custom; to sentiments, principles, collective interest,juridical, metaphysical, or supernatural entities; or may be verbal proofs, using metaphorical, dubious, or indefinite terms. There is little or no change in the intensity of a whole class of residues, though there is some in the genera of each class; residues are not equally distributed nor equally strong in the various strata of society. Residues may act upon other residues, and upon derivations; derivations may act upon residues and upon other derivations. In addition to these three elements of social phenomena there are interests, social heterogeneity, and the circulation of classes. The most prosperous society is the one in which the first two residues especially are found in a certain proportion, though this proportion cannot be given in figures."

Emotional factors strongly effect the ""fruitfulness"" and ""direction"" of the intelligence; but we still insist upon treating intelligence as a thing apart. Evidence is offered that intelligence is part of a total organic attitude involving also attitudes of mind, emotional conditions, ingrained habits, and conditioned behavior. In children of high-school age this total attitude is the essential factor in counseling and segregation. The greater the emotional contribution to the total attitude, the more subordinate is the intelligence. This attitude is a changing complex in response to situational factors. Transient situations may produce emotional disturbances reflected in lower results in mental testing at such times. The inequalities in mental tests from a given child are an index to his emotional capacity. The total organic attitude becomes more complex through the operation of a long-continued disturbing situation, possibly also through inherent characteristics of the individual reacting in extraordinary ways to temporary situations. Inasmuch as behavior grows out of this total attitude and decisions in domestic, educational, and vocational crises are dictated by it, the total attitude itself and the situational factors which produced it are the essential factors in counseling high-school children. Classes segregated according to these factors present more uniform teaching problems than classes segregated on the basis of intelligence tests alone."

Difference among religious and national groups in moral knowledge seem to be almost wholly a function of differences in level of intelligence. Socio-economic differences are reflected in school honesty, but only slightly in service tendencies, and these slight differences are swallowed up in community differences, as shown, e.g., by the superiority of a mid-social group in helpfulness and co-operation. The classroom group, although far from being a ""natural"" group, shows evidences of possessing a distinctive morale, or code, which operates as one factor in determining scores on tests of conduct and knowledge. It would seem that the pupils respond to the classroom (its prestige, expectancy, morale, code, teacher, or what not) as a factor common to all test situations. The result is a group correlation between knowledge and conduct which has no necessary counterpart in the individual integration of the members of the group. The more the members of groups resemble their own group-mates, the less differentiated they appear. The more groups as groups resemble one another the better differentiated the members may become. On the whole the integration of children in Grades 5 to 8 is only slightly more than chance would provide."

Aggregate measures of the socioeconomic composition of boards of directors of thirty-four branches of the YMCA of Chicago are found to be correlated with demographic measures on the areas each serves. Furthermore, the composition of the boards is correlated with measures of organizational and board effectiveness. The demographic measures are also correlated with the spatial work-residence patterns of board members. The over-all import of the study is to link ecological and organizational analysis."

Persons interested in becoming integrated members of a group are under pressure to impress the other members that they would make attractive associates, but the resulting competition for popularity gives rise to defensive tactics that block social integration. A member who can provide valued services to the others forces them to give up their defensive tendencies and manifest their attraction to him; the process in which his services are exchanged for their respect and defense gives rise to social differentiation. Alternatively, one who demonstrates his approachibility obviates the need for the difensiveness of other and thus frees them to express their feeling of attraction to him; the process in which his disclaimer of superordinate status is exchanged for their acceptance gives rise to social integration. Empirical data support the hypothesis that acceptance as a peer depends on approachability as well as attractiveness."

The decline of the private house ensembles (Hauskapellen) resulted in a social broadening of music patronage and thereby tended to erode the traditional institutional means for aristocratic authority in musical affairs. The exclusive function that the qualitatively different ideology of ""serious"" music could provide reaffirmed traditional cultural boundaries through ideological rather than institutional means and enabled Vienna's old aristocrats to emerge after 1800 as the city's ""most brilliant"" dilettantes."

These hypotheses are tested, employing an index of preference for suicide or homicide, the Suicide-Murder Ratio (SMR). Consideration of the socialization process as it is related to the American class structure resolves some issues raised by Henry and Short's theory of external restraint and effectively predicts the findings. The results are considered in terms of Durkheim's belief that the choice of suicide or homicide resulting from anomie is purely a psychological problem and from the standpoint of Henry and Short's assertion that the choice is in part determined by sociological variables."

It is probably more important that Negroes who attend integrated schools will have more contact with whites as adults, and tend to have more trust in whites than do Negroes from segregated schools. This in turn partially overcomes a crucial barrier to equal opportunity-the fact that information about employment opportunities is spread through types of informal social contacts to which few Negroes have access."

Achievement motivation, which apparently precedes delinquency and is positively related to it, is so related only for lower-and working-class boys. The author argues that this relationship probably results from the sensibity of law enforcement agents to high achievement motivation related behavior rather than from any inclination of highly motivated lower-class youhts to commit excessive amounts of crime."

This report deals with the extent and ways in which racial, urban, and certain other attitudes are influenced by city of residence. The initial evidence is formal in character and simply shows that city of residence accounts for significant proportions of variance in a wide range of attitudes-proportions not greatly different from those accounted for by five individual background variables (age, sex, education, income, and occupation) and largely independent of these background variables. Attitudes best explained by city seem to be those with some urban content, and specially those that involve individual perceptions of the immediate urban environment. The outcomes are similar for black and white respondents, and for some specific attitudes there is surprising similarity in the ranking of cities across race. Questions are raised about the relation of attitudes to urban riots: Detroit, which had a major riot, is moderate relative to other cities in attitudes presumed to be relevant to open racial conflict. Particularly promising is the finding that black dissatisfaction with life conditions in their city goes down as black percentage of the population goes up-possibly because the city government becomes more responsive to black needs. Liberal racial attitudes on the part of the white population are closely associated with variations in white educational levels by city. While part of this relatioship is simply a reflection of individual level correlations, part appears to be due to the indirect effects of education on the general climate of opinion in a city. City of residence would seem to be a useful explanatory variable in studies of attitudes."

The person as the Individual with Status: The study of individual behavior falls in the fields of psychiatry and psychology. The study of the person, as the product of social interaction, lies, primarily, in sociology.

Estimates of interpersonal influences based upon self-reported attributes are presented. It is shown that perceptual measures inflate estimates of interpersonal influence. Independent data from parents document that perceptual measures of significant others' attributes reflect not only attributes of the person being perceived but also attributes of the perceiver. Parental influence on the adolescent's aspirations is stronger than peer influence, and this influence does not decline over the adolescent years.

The motives bringing peoples of divergent races and cultures together are, in the first instance, economic. In the long run, economic intercouse enforces more intimate personal and cultural relations, and eventually amalgamation takes place. When the peoples involved are widely different in culture and in racial characteristics, and particularly when they are distinguished by physical marks, assimilation and amalgamation take place very slowly. When the resulting hybrid peoples exhibit physical traits that mark them off and distinguish them from both parent-stocks, the mixed bloods are likely to constitute a distinct caste or class occupying a position and status midway between the two races of which they are composed. The mixed bloods tend everywhere to be, as compared with the full bloods with whom they are identified, an intellectual and professional class. The most obvious and generally accepted explanation of the superiority of the mixed bloods is that the former are the products of two races, one of which is biologically inferior and the other biologically superior. In the case of the Negro-white hybrids in the United States, other and less obvious explanations have been offered. It has been pointed out, for example, that the mulatto is the result of a social selection which began during the period os slavery, when the dominant whites selected for their concubines the most comely, and presumably the superior, women among the Negroes. There is, however, the fact to be considered that in a society where racial distinctions are rigidly maintained, the mixed blood tends to be keenly conscious of his position. He feels, as he frequently says, the conflict of warring ancestry in his veins. The conflict of color is embodied, so to speak, in his person. His minds is the melting pot in which the lower and the higher cultures meet and fuse."

Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.

This paper discusses the guardians of impersonal trust and discovers that, in the quest for agent fidelity, they create new problems. The resulting collection of procedural norms, structural constraints, entry restrictions, policing mechanisms, social-control specialists, and insurance-like arrangements increases the opportunities for abuse while it encourages less acceptable trustee performance. Moreover, this system sometimes leads people to throw good ""money"" after bad; they protect trust and respond to its failures by conferring even more trust. The paper explores the sources and consequences of the paradox that the guardians of trust are themselves trustees."

This study proposes a model of endogeneity among organizations, the professions, and legal institutions. It suggests that organizations and the professions strive to construct rational responses to law, enabled by ""rational myths"" or stories about appropriate solutions that are themselves modeled after the public legal order. Courts, in turn, recognize and legitimate organizational structures that mimic the legal form, thus conferring legal and market benefits upon organizational structures that began as gestures of compliance. Thus, market rationality can follow from rationalized myths: the professions promote a particular compliance strategy, organizations adopt this strategy to reduce costs and symbolize compliance, and courts adjust judicial constructions of fairness to include these emerging organizational practices. To illustrate this model, a case study of equal employment opportunity (EEO) grievance procedures is presented in this article."

This article makes such an attempt with all Western European countries experiencing democratic rule between 1870 and 1939. It seeks (1) to explain what structural and historical features distinguish the breakdown cases from those that remained democratic, and (2) to trace the process of class coalition formation in the transition to democracy and the subsequent breakdown. Moore's thesis does fit, with some modification. All four breakdwn cases were characterized historically by an authoritarian coalition of labor-repressive landlords, the state, and the bourgeoisie that contributed to the breakdown of democratic rule in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast, in none of the democratic survivors did such a coalition materialize. This difference can be traced largely to the strenght of the agrarian elite in the late 19th century. However, in contrast to Moore's characterization of the conservative authoritarian path, the ruling coalition, except in Germany, did not play a modernizing role, and only in Austria can the bourgeoisie be described as a ""dependent"" partner in the coalition. Moreover, because it stops too early, Moore's analysis greatly underplays the role of the organized working class in the transition to democracy and attributes far too positive a role to the bourgeoisie."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and effects of workers’ responses to the changes they confront in their work situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing a fourfold typology of workers’ responses, the author shows how each type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the restructuring of their jobs."

Both university scholars and humanists were rationally trained. Their methods, however, were determined by their professional conditions and differed substantially from the methods of science. Both professors and humanistic literati distinguished liberal from mechanical arts and despised manual labor, experimentation, and dissection. Craftsmen were the pioneers of causal thinking in this period. Certain groups of superior manual labores (artistengineers, surgeons, the makers of nautical and musical instruments, surveyors, navigators, gunners) experimented, dissected, and used quantitative methods. The measuring instruments of the navigators, surveyors, and gunners were the forerunners of the later physical instruments. The craftsmen, however, lacked methodical intellectual training. Thus the two components of the scientific method were separated by a social barrier: logical training was reserved for upper-class scholars; experimentation, causal interest, and quantitative method were left to more or less plebeian artisans. Science was born when, with the progress of technology, the experimental method eventually overcame the social prejudice against manual labor and was adopted by rationally trained scholars. This was accomplished about 1600 (Gilbert, Galileo, Bacon). At the same time the scholastic method of disputation and the humanistic ideal of individual glory were superseded by the ideals of control of nature and advancement of learning through scientific co-operation. In a somewhat different way, sociologically, modern astronomy developed. The whole process was imbedded in the advance of early capitalistic society, which weakened collective-mindedness, magical thinking, and belief in authority and which furthered worldly, causal, rational, and quantitative thinking."

The argument is that continued economic development in our society has led to increases in the demand for female labor which, combined with demographically induced shifts in the supply of unmarried and young women, have resulted in the considerable post-World War II rise in the labor-force participation of married women. The evidence is that these changes are irreversible and will not be greatly affected by the entry of the baby-boom cohorts into the labor market. Nevertheless, women's increasing dissatisfaction with job opportunities can be expected because several of the higher-level traditional female occupations will probably not expand greatly in the near future."

These two related dimensions of political information processing emerge from a detailed content analysis of depth interview transcripts. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the way citizens relate the condition of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and to political authorities. As expected, education plays a central role in explaning these patterns, but there are some surprising interactive linkages between education and patterns of political thought. One specially intriguing finding is that conservatives have significantly lower scores than liberals on indices of differentiation and integration. The ramifications of these findings for survey research methodology and theories of mass political behavior are discussed."

With large immigrations of other racial and cultural groups, the Chinese rose in economic and political position, while the Hawaiian culture became increasingly disintegrated and the Hawaiian group more and more disorganized. Intermarriage between pure Chinese and pure Hawaiians became relatively infrequent. A modification of the bi-racial pattern has also come about throught the Americanization of Hawaii.

Such a conception of local culture makes it, not a residual left over after economic analysis has its say, but an integral element in an ecological approach which increasingly draws implicitly or explicitly on social as well as economic differences in explaining our urban society."

The results show that mechanisms related to stress and adaptation (violent crime, reciprocal exchange and participation in local voluntary associations) are the most robust neighborhood‐level predictors of birth weight. Second, are contextual influences on health limited to the immediate neighborhood or do they extend to a wider geographic context? The results show that contextual effects on birth weight extend to the social environment beyond the immediate neighborhood, even after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. These findings suggest that the theoretical understanding and empirical estimation of “neighborhood effects” on health are bolstered by collecting data on more causally proximate social processes and by taking into account spatial interdependencies among neighborhoods."

These groups recruit individuals with aspirations for social and economic improvement who are without a network of secular relationships to aid them in time of emergency and help them obtain better social and economic positions. In comparison with Catholics, Protestants are younger and more likely to be self-employed. They also are more likely to be migrants who have few family ties in the city. The social organization of neighborhood Protestant groups entails encompassing moral and secular relationships that effectively provide for members' economic and social needs. The effects of these groups under the conditions of Guatemala City are to provide economic security rather than rapid economic improvement and to withdraw members from overt political co-operation with people of similar social and economic position."

Recently released audio recordings are used to argue that the key conversational activity was storytelling about an uncertain future. Kennedy’s choice of a blockade hinged on the narrative “suppression” of its most dangerous possible consequence, namely the perils of a later attack against operational missiles, something accomplished through omission, self-censorship, ambiguation, uptake failure, and narrative interdiction.

From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the “epistemic accident,” grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."

In particular, the authors consider the role of each target's vulnerabilities and its capacities for response—repression, facilitation, and routinization—as explanations for the degree of transgressive protest each target faces. The results provide strong evidence for considering targets as a central factor in shaping forms of social protest."

Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a “moving target,” with state and societal actors building on legal as well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced explanations of state policy that are both “political” and “institutional” and that highlight the centrality of legal interpretation and judicial review to political sociology."

This pattern is also alleged to account for the growth in racial inequality in wages over the same period. This article reports on a case study of the retooling of a food processing plant. A unique, longitudinal, multimethod design reveals the nature of the technological change, the changes in job requirements, and the mechanisms by which the changes affect the wage distribution for hourly production workers. This research finds that, indeed, the retooling resulted in greater wage dispersion and that the changes have also been associated with greater racial inequality in wages. However, contrary to the claims of advocates of the skill‐bias hypothesis, organizational and human resources factors strongly mediated the impact of the changing technology. Absent these “high road” organizational choices, this impact on wage distribution would have been even more extreme."

Until recently, in the absence of sociologists, the social workers have been the only representatives of the social sciences. Social psychiatry, distinguished by the situational approach, is in the course of development. The division of labor between social psychiatry and clinical sociology is in need of clarification. The cultural approach.-While a sociological clinic is as unthinkable as a psychiatric clinic, each specialist has a distinctive point of view, and the sociologists have made a contribution through the cultural approach, which is based upon the conception that behavior becomes a problem when it represents a deviation from the definitions prevailing in a cultural milieu, and can be understood and controlled only in terms of this cultural background. Through the sociological conception of personality which emphasizes social status and the playing of roles in social groups many forms of conduct become intelligible. The scope of clinical sociology.-Research, consulation with and training of other specialists, and direct participation in study and treatment of cases are possible tasks of sociologists in clinics. The work with problems of personality and community life which the sociologists undertakes is not at present carried on except incidentally and directly. The manipulation of the social world and the modification of attitudes are the chief therapeutic problems sociologist. Social worker, in addition to their present training, need training in clinical sociology.

The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

Especially significant have been the influences operating upon children and youth. There is nearly universal conviction that direct relief has hurt family life.

Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide.

Homogamy and in-marriage are not characteristic of the social strata in African states, which tend to encourage marriage between groups of different status, hence these groups tend not to develop in isolation with distinctive modes of life. Out-marriage and bridewealth in Africa stand in contrast to in-marriage and dowry in Eurasia. It is suggested that the more intesive form of agriculture in the latter area encouraged the preservation of familial status by the transmission, inter alia, of property ot females (e.g., the dowry) as well as males, a procedure which strongly encourages the marriage of like with like. In africa, out-marriage strengthens the social ties and cultural similarities within a society. As a consequence, ""class conflict"" was less significant in the political system, although the situation is now changing in the ""modern"" sector."

Failure to specify the theoretical context creates ambiguity as to the level of distinctness, and leads to the partialling fallacy, in which one controls for variables that are  distinct in terms of appropriate theory. Although this can occur in using any control procedure, it is especially likely to occur in multiple regression, where high-order partial regression coefficients are routinely obtained in order to determine the relative importance of variables. Four major ways in which these regression coefficients can be seriously misleading are discussed. Although warnings concerning multicollinearity are to be found in statistics texts, they are insufficiently informative to prevent the mistakes described here. This is because the problem is essentially one of substantive interpretation rather than one of mathematical statistics per se."

Beginning with the claim that historians of sociology need to look beyond the now-famous ideas that appear in the foreground of the works of the sociological masters, the article examines the neglected idea of habit to document that this concept was long a staple term in the conceptual vocabulary of Western social theorists and that it continued to function as a major background factor in the substantive writings of both Emile Durkheim and Max Weber-a factor that previous scholarship on Durkheim and Weber has almost completely overlooked. It is shown that Durkheim viewed habit not only as a chief determinant of human action in a great variety of areas but also as one of the principal supports for the moral fabric of modern societies. Similarly, habit is found to be significant in Weber's treatment of modern economic and political life, Calvinism and the spirit of capitalism, and the force of traditionalism, which is so central a factor in his framework for comparative-historical analysis. Although the idea of habit was also used extensively in American sociology down to around 1918, in the course of the two decades that followed the concept was purpose fully excised from the conceptual structure of the field. This dramatic change is shown to be a result of the interdisciplinary disputes that surrounded the institutionalization of sociology as an academic."

The semiotic approach is contrasted with Marxian hegemony theory. Because cultural objects mean different things to different social groups, only semiotic analysis fully specifies the multiplicity of meanings involved in mass culture. The semiotic model views meaning as being exchanged in three separate and qualitatively different stages. Its application results in the proposal for a different kind of textual analysis than that used by contemporary mass culture analysts and in the observation that users of mass culture are more active and creative than previously supposed."

A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites—a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority—assume an oppositional posture.

The pattern of mobility they find suggests that agency problems associated with the loyalties of newly acquired workers dominated early experiments with lateral transfers.

This hypothesis is arrived at throught a functional comparison of the psychoanalytical analysis of the dependency situation of the child with that of the slave, and the psychoanalytical analys is of the problem of masochism with that of the meek, fre Negro. There is no structural similarity in either comparison, but the functional comparison offers a clue to understanding the strength of the concealed hostility behind these two roles and the compensations they offer.

The results suggest that initial token status can have a lasting impact on attachment and that increases in attachment in integrated groups occur through a cohort‐replacement process. The turnover dynamics also imply that any gains in the representation of minority groups are very fragile. The challenge of workplace racial integration therefore lies not simply in eliminating discrimination in hiring, but also in managing the post‐hire consequences of changes in group composition. Implications of the asymmetric effects of compositional change for the literature on organizational demography are also discussed."

Among the professional officials, however, a different dynamic was at work. They were more likely to look to the state for the implementation of their policy recommendations. And authors who looked to the state were more likely to perceive relations rather than aggregates. These findings speak to certain wider issues in the history of sociology and the sociology of knowledge, including thetransition of sociology away from its original value-laden stance, and the necessity for sociologists of knowledge to use quite different approaches toward the understanding of cognitions and of evaluative styles."

Thurstone,American Journal of Sociology,33,4,1928-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 529-554,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The object of this study is to devise a method whereby the distribution of attitude of a group on a specified issue may be represented in the form of a frequency distribution. The base line represents ideally the whole range of opinions from those at one end who are most strongly in favor of the issue to those at the other end of the scale who are as strongly against it. Somewhere between the two extremes on the base line will be a neutral zone representing indifferent attitudes on the issue in question. The ordinates of the frequency distribution will represent the relative popularity of each attitude. This measurement problem has the limitation which is common to all measurement, namely, that one can measure only such attributes as can be represented on a linear continuum, such attributes as volume, price, length, area, excellence, beauty, and so on. For the present problem we are limited to those aspects of attitudes for which one can compare individuals by the ""more and less"" type of judgment. For example, we say understandingly that one man is more in favor of prohibition than another, more strongly in favor of the League of Nations than another, more militaristic than some other, more religious than another. The measurement is effected by the indorsement or rejection of statements of opinion. The opinions are allocated to different positions on the base line in accordance with the attitudes which they express. The ordinates of the frequency distribution are determined by the frequency with which each of the scaled opinions is indorsed. The center of the whole problem lies in the definition of a unit of measurement for the base line. The scale is so constructed that two opinions separated by a unit distance on the base line seem to differ as much in the attitude variable involved as any other two opinions on the scale which are also separated by a unit distance. This is the main idea of the present scale construction. The true allocation of an individual to a position on an attitude scale is an abstraction, just as the true length of a chalk line, or the true temperature of a room, or the true spelling ability of a child, is an abstraction. We estimate the true length of a line, the true temperature of a room, or the true spelling ability of a child, by means of various indices, and it is a commonplace in measurement that all indices do not agree exactly. In allocating an individual to a point on the attitude continuum we may use various indices, such as the opinions that he indores, his overt acts, and his past history, and it is to be expected that discrepancies will appear as the true attitude of the individual is estimated by different indices. The present study is concerned with the allocation of individuals along an attitude continuum based on the opinions that they accept or reject."

At the same time, because of the characteristics identifying it with the dominant group, it protests against identification with the subordinate group, to which it holds itself superior, and it achieves a status much above that occupied by the subordinate parent-group. This formula of race, which is descriptive of many situations, may be applied with exactitude to two racial islands in America, the Creoles and the Cajuns, both in Alabama. Although quite different in social traits and qualities-in industry, in thrift and cleanliness, in social organization, in intellectual ability, in culture-these two groups are alike in having to occupy distinctive social positions, on the one hand disclaimed by their white parent-groups and on the other hand themselves disclaiming their Negro parents.

The object of so-called ""sychic warfare"" is to destroy morale, particularly the morale of the civil population. The effect has been, when successful, to paralyze the national will, making collective action impossible. Nations exist only when and in so far as they are able to act. The methods of creating national solidarity and for destroying it are abundantly illustrated in recent events in Europe. Propaganda is ordinarily the weapon with which civilian morales is destroyed, if not created. With the more extensive use of the arts and devices of psychic warfare, war has tended to assume the character of a dialectic process, in which it appears not as a struggle of physical forces merely but ideas and ideologies. News makes public opinion; but public opinion is sometimes, if not always inimical morale. It is inimical to morale when it tends to intensify differences of attitude and opinion. But discussion, upon which public opinion is based, in so far as it brings into the open sentiments and attitudes that would otherwise be suppressed, tends to bring about understanding and unity. By so doing it improves morale. War and conflict may be said to function when they bring about an understanding upon which a secure peace may be based."

Indices of role specificity are developed, based on analysis of the persuasive appeals clients offered in support of their requests. Lacking direct information on the three factors mentioned above, we used five personal and social characteristics of clients to predict whether they would maintain role specificity vis-a-vis customs officials. The client's occupation proved to be the best predictor of role specificity, probably because it best reflects the three factors promoting bureaucratic socialization."

The present paper presents a model of justice norms as congnitions and tests the degree of cognitive consensus on the norm of just deserts (i.e., ""letting the punishment fit the crime""). It is argued that consensus on justice norms should be tested using a combination of within-respondent and between-respondent techniques. Such tests can (1) simultaneously reveal the presence of consensus on the justice principle involved and on the evaluation of the specific social stimuli presented, (2) facilitate demographic comparisons on adhering to principle or agreeing on facts, and (3) reveal conflicts between these two versions of consensus. For testing the norm of just deserts, ratio scale measures of crime seriousness and punishment severity were employed, and a formula derived from both equity theory and psychophysics was utilized in model fitting. Results from a sample survey indicated dramatically strong use of the principle of just deserts by members of the public but less adherence to just deserts by demographically disadvantaged (low-income or black) respondents. A path model of the relation between aggregate and individual scores further demonstrated a fundamental tension between the two versions of normative consensus, in that the more respondents used the principle the more systematically they deviated from the group average response. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of both the substantive findings and the new methodologies employed for understanding normative consensus and the assessment of justice norms."

The latter model can be used to analyze adaptive strategies groups resort to in competitive situations, such as occur during modernization. At one extreme, groups may maximize their relative population size and use political means to claim and hold a share of a society's resources. This strategy is well known, and several theorists emphasize the advantages of large relative size in ethnic group relations. This paper focuses on the strategy at the other end of the continuum. Bioecologists use the term ""r-strategists"" to refer to especies which maximize their ability to discover ephemeral resources, exploit them quickly, and then disperse in search of new resources. Gypsies and Travellers in modern states are discussed as examples of ethnic r-strategists. These groups are seen to maximize their ability to discover and exploit resources which are irregular in space and time and subject to numerous and varying local constraints through their nomadism and flexible organization.

This variation affects the ability of the agencies to compete for federal funds. Agencies in wealthier states can afford to pay higher salaries and provide unemployment insurance for a greater proportion of the total unemployed. Such mechanisms allow these agencies to obtain a disproportionate share of the limited federal tax funds in spite of the attempts of the federal government to equalize the economic burdens of the employment program. The stratification system in which the employment agencies exist also affects the tasks which they pursue. Employment agencies in wealthier states concentrate on unemployment-compensation tasks, while those in poorer states emphasize placement services. It is demostrated that, aside from other factors, emphasis on unemployment functions (which wealthy states can more easily afford) has positive feedback effects on the share of federal tax money which a state receives."

These sequences are promulgated by intentional actors who cue cultural forms (rituals) in order to guide interaction.

Using interviews and ethnographic accounts of behaviors in 165 classrooms at two high schools, this article describes the nature of each stage and the strategies used by both protagonists and antagonists of change. Since social dramas are disruptive episodes of social action, special attention is paid to the potential they have for transforming the social order, thereby affecting micro‐ to macrolevel change."

Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers."

Structure and attitudes are commonly taken as conditioners of the mobility experience, moderating or heightening its hypothesized effects on (for example) feelings of social isolation, ethnic prejudice, sense of relative deprivation, and political radicalism or conservatism. The analysis, however, argues strongly in support of French-American similarity rather than difference, in two major respects: (1) mobility attitudes showed the same basic structure and correlation pattern; and (2) as expected, the effects which can be attributed to objective mobility were highly limited in both countries."

Competing causal claims have been the subject of considerable disagreement, culminating in the debate between Clampet‐Lundquist and Massey and Ludwig et al. in this issue. This article assesses the debate by clarifying analytically distinct questions posed by neighborhood‐level theories, reconceptualizing selection bias as a fundamental social process worthy of study in its own right rather than a statistical nuisance, and reconsidering the scientific method of experimentation, and hence causality, in the social world of the city. The author also analyzes MTO and independent survey data from Chicago to examine trajectories of residential attainment. Although MTO provides crucial leverage for estimating neighborhood effects on individuals, as proponents rightly claim, this study demonstrates the implications imposed by a stratified urban structure and how MTO simultaneously provides a new window on the social reproduction of concentrated inequality."

This disparity led to a university-level enrollment squeeze, and the resulting bottleneck hurt disadvantaged classes more than advantaged ones. In turn the effect of social origins on entering university increased after 1965. The upshot was no net change in the origin-based differences in likelihood of attaining a VUZ degree across three postwar cohorts."

The great number, the dense concentration, and the isolated group life of some of these, together with their subordinate social position and the consequences of our past Amerivanization policies, raise questions about our national solidarity. The disadvantaged position of our minorities lends itself redily to exploitation by foreign governments. The Nazis and Fascists have employed a propaganda and orgaizational campaign designed for American conditions. Their appeals are directed in part to the minorities, in part to the dominant groups. The situation thus crated inclines us to adopt remedial and precautionary measures, some of which are ill advised. Our strategy of morale-building might well capitalize on the diverse origin of our people and our democratic traditions. Our experience in the last war and the lessons learned from the conquered nations of Europe suggest a more effective national policy for us. We are likely to get better morale by emphasizing our common aspirations rather than our common memories because, if our minorities can be convinced that their minority status is not permanent and that they can hope to share fully in the promises of democracy, their effort in the national enterprise can be relied upon."

Because their sex status is defined within the culture of professions as inappropriate, women find that the institutionalized channels of recruitment and advancement, such as the protege system, are not available to them. Various modes of behavior on the part of women and their colleagues are described which are consequences of women's minority position and which reinforce it.

The Catholic church down through the ages has taken a stand midway between professional militarism and absolute pacificism. Virtus stat in medio has its application in this as in most other practical matters. While propounding by preachment and by precept the ideal of universal charity and mutual tolerance in thought and deed, she has not failed to recognize the individual's inalienable right to vigorous self-defense. Likewise, the church recognizes and clearly defines the duty of the state-which is organized for society and not vice-versa-to protect its people and their interests by upholding the adequate sanctions of law and other. The right of santuary, the ""Peace of God,"" the ""Truce of God,"" and many laws regulating warfare are among the concrete achievements of the church in preventing or in mitigating the horrors of war. So too must be counted the efforts of the many popes from early times down to the present day, who have raised their voices to protest against international hatreds and injustices, to mediate in such crises, and to lend their efforts to prevent wars.

Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length.

Such influence activities may bring benefits to the organization, but they also involve real costs. This essay offers an economic rationale for such influence activity as representing rational, self-interested behavior in the presence of informational asymmetries and an analysis of how the design of the organization's structure and polices should respond to the incentives for attempting influence. It is posited that information valuable for the organization's decision making is directly available only to members of the organization who have some personal stake in the decisions. These individuals may then have an incentive to try to manipulate the information they develop and provide in order to influence the resulting decision to their benefits. This can be costly both in degrading the quality of decision making and in diverting the attention and effort of the organization's members from more productive activities. The organization has three different methods it can employ to discourage excessive influence activities and to encourage more directly productive uses of time and effort. It can limit access to decision makers and participation in decision making; it can alter its decision-making criteria to favor those performing well in productive activities; and it can provide direct financial incentives to encourage the desired allocation of effort. It is shown that an efficiently deisgned organization will use such financial incentives only as a last resort. Instead, it will always first alter its decision-participation polices and decision-making criteria."

The managerial conception of diversity adds a variety of nonlegal dimensions of diversity (e.g., personality traits) to the legally protected categories like race and sex, and it disassociates diversity from civil rights law."

Woodworth,American Journal of Sociology,44,6,1939-05-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 823-828,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Team work, certainly an important form of group activity, consists in action by each member of a group upon the same object and toward the same objective goal. Adequately conceived, the individual's behavior does not terminate in his muscular contractions but includes the objective results accomplished, which are determined by constraining factors in the environment as well as by the individual's muscular activity. The individual becomes adjusted to the objective situation and works toward an objective result, and the members of a team are adjusted to the same situation and work toward the same result. Thus the individual participates in group activity, as he also participates in other environmental happenings such as the motion of a swing. Instead of participationhe may offer resistance to environmental forces. Participation, then, is not forced on the individual but grows out of his fundamental objectivity of outlook and effort. The root of group activity is the individual's tendency to participate."

It unites those of a social class and segregates them from others. The eliete initiates fashion and, when the mass imitates it in an effort to obliterate the external distinctions of class, abandons it for a newer mode-a process that quickens with the increase of wealth. Fashion does not exist in tribal and classless societies. It concerns externals and superficialities where irrationality does no harm. It signalizes the lack of personal freedom; hence it characterizes the female and the middle class, whose increased social freedom is matched by intense individual subjugation. Some forms are intrinsically more suited to the modifications of fashion than others: the internal unity of the forms called ""classic"" makes them immune to change."

Can it be also (5) a compound? It cannot be a member of itself for this would violate the ""vicious circle"" principle. It may be said to be homogeneous with its members. But the question is whether the distinguishing functions of a social whole are of the same type as that of a whole man. The principle of unity may be (a) of a different type, (b) quantitatively different, (c) higher than, or (d) lower than, its members. Our minds should be rid of the assumption that a more inclusive whole must be of a higher order. It is possible to regard society as different in type from a man, as was done in the medieval conception of the universal community. Therefore the unity of society is not necessarily the same as unity of mind. Nor is it possible to contend that society and man are quantitatively different. As to higher and lower, the more unified and more versatile are higher, and owing to the complexity of our life a human ""cell"" belongs to many bodies, so that the firm hold on the parts is lost and the unity which distinguishes developed organisms does not exist. Moreover, the approach in mechanized industry to the solidarity of an organism may debase the members of it. It seems clear that the things which a social group can do are less worth doing than what a man at his best can do. Social groups are wholes, but they are wholes of an inferior type. Is society a mind? Yes, if we refer to the lower functions or habits, or abstract functions as unified control but not the higher unities. A caution must be made against personification which leads to superstitious veneration and idolatry. Finally, the social mind must refer to the difference in behavior due to social causes. The social mind is therefore not a new being of a higher order."

This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France."

When former college teachers were evaluated, men students ranked women less favorably than men, but women students ranked men less favorably than women. Although a substantial minority of students had no sex preference for instructor in any size of class, among those who did, more preferred men teachers than women, and the larger the class, the greater was the preference for a man teacher.

Bourdieu's ahistorical structuralism fails to grasp the historical changes produced in culture by capitalism, while critical theory's essentialism fails to specify the concrete factors mediating the historical effects of capitalism on culture. As a corrective to both, a neo-Marxist theory is developed that grasps the totality of capitalist culture by grounding the effects of class on culture in concrete, historical class struggle."

Substantively, cumulative war costs, public opinion, and antiwar demonstrations all had significant effects on Senate roll call outcomes, but they were so highly intercorrelated that their separate effects could not be disentangled. In addition, demonstrations taking place in the months before a vote had a slight positive impact on the number of dovish votes received by motions. The 1970 invasion of Cambodia seems to have led to a significant turning point in the way the Senate dealt with the war. The general strengths and weaknesses of the new approach are assessed.

These histories show that, contrary to expectations, market potential has the greatest influence on winning when league authority is formally strongest. Market potential has no influence on performance when league authority is opposed by antitrust law, player unions, rival leagues, or league members. To explain this anomaly, authority and market relations must both be seen as embedded within the multiplex relations among team owners. These relations changed dramatically with the rise of national audiences in the past three decades. Inequality among equals replaced inequality among unequals as the support of a rootless national audience replaced rooted and unequal local audiences, altering the opportunity context of owners."

But there are many obstacles to research in this field, viz., the complexity of the material, the paucity of statistical data, the difficulties of controlled experimentation. the existence of dogmatic interpretations, and the corrupt and predatory interests that are adverse to research. Three main lines of inquiry are open to us: legal, statistical, and sociological, Legal research is now being prosecuted relative to the administration of the criminal law; but, at best, the law is somewhat external to problems of criminology. Its outlook is not conspicuously that of science, except where legal procedure has become socialezed. In regard to criminal statistics we may say that the statistical method of accumulation and correlation, while informing us of general tendencies, does not give us causes in specific instances, nor does it reveal the selfhood of the criminal, which is the real criminologic problem. This latter is reached only through a truly sociological method, which interprets behavior in terms of organic impulse and of social conditions, and of their mutually interacting relationship. The two indispensable devices for the sociologist in this matter are the individual case history and the community case history. The technique of the former is well known; that of the latter needs further development and application. Fortunately, research projects are now under way or contemplated, for the correlation of these two forms of the sociologic approach."

In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions.

The social function of communication seems to be to bring about and maintain understanding and cultural solidarity among individuals and societies. It may be contrasted with the social function of competition which is to bring about an orderly distribution and a division of labor between individuals and societies. This division of labor, so far as it is brought about by competition, involves the individuation of the competing units. Competition and communication may thus be said to suplement each other, since communication operates as an integrating and socializing principle, while competition is the principles of individuation. More specifically, communication may be said to operate in two dimensions. On the one hand, it serves to bring about a diffusion of cultural traits and so widen the cultural area within which socia relations may exist. On the other hand, communication, in so far as it brings diverse cultural influences into focus at some center of communication, like the rural village or metropolitan city, tends the bring into the common understanding new ideas-ideas that inevitably arise in the ferment, confusion, and conflict of the acculturation process. The processes of diffusion and acculturation seem to take place in the manner and under the conditions in which news is collected and diffused. It is characteristic of news that it circulates as far as its message is understood and seems important. It is probable, however, that the cinema, which circulates not news, but pictures, is more devastating in its effects upon local cultures and in bringing the widely dispersed people of the world within the influence of a single culture of civilization than is the news proper."

Three central contingencies of an initial metamorphosis, from sober dispositions to doing laughter, are specified. The would-be laugher must collaboratively construct the presumption that another person shares his or her perspective on the mirror's reflections, develop mutually untenable definitions of a person and that person's reflections, and display a corporeal appreciation of the sensed juxtaposition. Each of these dimensions is altered when participants undergo a second metamorphosis, a shift to being done by the spirit raised. A final section analyzes the trascendent powers of family relations as they play on glaces bizarres."

Partial support for each hypothesis is reported. The relation of collective knowledge to collective memory is also considered."

Thus, Riley et al. (1969) argue that, in addition to myriad small adjustements, ""major adjustments are also required as the occupational role gives way to one of leisure-in-retirement; as the combined roles of spouse-and-parent shift, after the children leave home, to the role of spouse without parental responsibilities, and later to widowhood; as relationships to descendant kin proliferate to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and numerous in-laws; and as preparation is made for ultimate death."" This paper focuses on the last of these ""major adjustments""-""preparation... for ultimate death""-and argues that congregate living facilities can provide optimal settings for this form of socialization. It views a retirement village as a relatively ""non-total"" (Goffman 1961) ""people-processing institution"" in which residents themselves devise means for their collective socialization for impending death.

In the case of the Pennsylvania German, the Lutheran traditionalism of faith has become a radiant center for the integration of a consciousness of self, of difference and of kind. A historical creed has here rationalized the process of life upon terms of its own. By conditioning an ego it determined the development of its organs of self-preservation, a functional type ideal, a specific societal technique, a language, a school system. It thus determined the performance of that type as a socius: his function in the social constitution and in the creation of values. By indicating distinct mind frontiers, by sanctioning terms of dissociation as well as consociation, religion appears here as the grandam of sectionalism and as a vital condition of the social process in America."

Observations were made of seventy-nine working-and middle-class boys and girls while engaged at two achievement tasks, one with their mothers and the other with their fathers. Children were most likely to cheat when their parents exerted pressure on them to succeed. Parental pressure, in turn, comes about when parents entertain high aspirations for their children coupled with limited resources. Neither high aspirations with more ample material resources nor limited resources with more modest aspirations are as apt to result in parental pressure and its consequent cheating by children. Cheating can thus be an unwitting result of striving after culturally valued goals under conditions of limited opportunity."

It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate‐sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy‐set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate‐sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences."

Further, among all organizations in three populations—peace, women's issues, and human rights—NMAOs have not displaced MAOs.

Development of nationalistic societies, taking forms corresponding to movements in China, indicate further enlargement of the migrants' social world. Another shift in the area of group loyalties is revealed in the establishment of institutions designed to deal with problems confronting the Chinese community in Hawaii as a whole. Increased identification with the envolving Hawaiian society is represented by individual migrants who became citizens and functionaries of the Hawaiian government. The assimilation of the Hawaiian-born Chinese must be analyzed in terms of this changing configuration of identifications and loyalties of the immigrants."

To a striking degree, the same syndrome of attitudes, values, and ways of acting-such as openness to new experience, independence from parental authority, and taking an active part in civic affairs-defines the modern man in each of the six countries and in all the occupational groups of cultivator, craftsman, and industrial worker. Education is the most powerful factor in making men modern, but occupational experience in large-scale organizations, and especially in factory work, makes a significant contribution in ""schooling"" men in modern attitudes and in teaching them to act like modern men. Those who come from very traditional backgrounds and receive little formal schooling can, under the right circumstances, still become modern in adult life. Modern men in developing countries not only have modern attitudes, but they can be shown to behave differently. Despite popular impressions to the contrary, exposure to the influence of migration and modern institutions does not lead to psychic distress."

Macpherson shows that disalienation is possible in Marxist theory only if material abundance or undifferentiated access to the means of production is provided. In contrast, Parsons's approach to the study of modern society emphasizes that differentiated responsibility and authority for production and organization are irreversible and increasing. Because of this systemic trend toward functional differentiation, a single normative standard for recognizing either necessity or abundance in absolute terms cannot be assumed. Parsons's analytical approach to the economic subsystem of the social system also moves him to reject economists' notions of consumer sovereignty and utility. Thus, his schema dismisses a anachronisms bothe the ""absolutism"" of the model of the free market."

Beyond the theoretical analysis, the author attempts to account for the dramatic growth of the white population share in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. Because the effects of racial classification and differential reproduction were roughly offsetting, the observed growth of the white share can be attributed almost entirely to racial switching."

Antonio,American Journal of Sociology,94,4,1989-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 721-748,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"From the start, emancipatory theory has been plagued by contradictory and incompletely elaborated normative underpinnings that weaken its sociological and ethical credibility. Jurgen Habermas, the leading contemporary critical theorist, has attempted to address this problem in an extensive reconstruction of the theories of Marx and Weber that appropriates elements of American pragmatist thought. Yet he resorts to an evolutionary normative argument that undermines the sociological powers of the two classical theories and contradicts the pragmatists' historical approach to values. This essay explains the significance of Habermasian theory for the emancipatory tradition, analyzes certain problems of the theory, and argues that an expanded dialogue with American pragmatism would strengthen both its sociological and its normative dimensions. Though the explicit focus is on the emancipatory tradition, the essay raises broader critical questions about pseudohistorical, normative justification in general sociological theory."

While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance."

Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals’ positions in a three‐dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith‐Lovin, MacKinnon), the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social structural, circumstantial, and individual‐level variables. Viewing emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience, structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion management that may have been overlooked in other studies."

Using the American General Social Surveys and the World Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being irreligious constitutes risk‐taking behavior. This model is able to predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed."

It offers the opportunity of gaining experience in the technique of planning, the appraisal of the resources and the deficiencies of the area to be planned, the selection of social and economic objectives, the choice of machinery for executing the plans, and the check-up of results of planned policies. The experiment also promises to throw light on the question as to what type of region is best adapted to planning. In the Tennessee Valley the region of power distribution is different from the flood-control area, and the homogeneous socio-economic subregions also transcend the drainage basin. As the experiment has recently been inaugurated, greater progress has been made in the execution of the engineering plans for power production, flood control, navigation, and fertilizer manufacture than in the socio-economic field. Basic studies have, however, been undertaken looking toward the stimulation of agriculture and industry and strengthening social institutions."

Each occupation maintains a sense of superior production (an ""occupational aesthetic"") that is not reducible to organizational demands. This perspective extends the production of culture approach that sees art as being like all work, suggesting, in contrast, that all work is like art. An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task."

The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross‐national variation in gender differences with country‐level predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women."

The authors also explore ways in which attention to the emotional realms of experience adds to traditional treatments of the impact of adult transition events (e.g., the “good marriage effect”). Interviews with male and female adolescent offenders and two waves of adult follow‐up data document general patterns of association and support the argument that a social view of emotional processes is critical to a comprehensive understanding of life course patterns of criminal continuity and change."

Findings show that the process of form emergence is subject to population‐dependent effects akin to those noted previously for organizational entries within established populations. The aggregate density and size of organizations with similar identities increase the probability of form emergence to a point (cross‐form legitimation), but highly saturated regions of the identity space tend to be uninviting to new forms (cross‐form competition)."

The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses.

Yet neither approach accounts for the experiences of ostensibly illegal grassroots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in an authoritarian state. Drawing on fieldwork in China, I argue that grassroots NGOs can survive in an authoritarian regime when the state is fragmented and when censorship keeps information local. Moreover, grassroots NGOs survive only insofar as they refrain from democratic claims-making and address social needs that might fuel grievances against the state. For its part, the state tolerates such groups as long as particular state agents can claim credit for any good works while avoiding blame for any problems. Grassroots NGOs and an authoritarian state can thus coexist in a “contingent symbiosis” that—far from pointing to an inevitable democratization—allows ostensibly illegal groups to operate openly while relieving the state of some of its social welfare obligations."

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage."

Two types of regionalism are distinguished: peripheral sectionalism, based on the salience of a distinctive cultural indentity in a given territory, the periphery; and functional sectionalism, based on the specific social structural composition of a given territory. According to a widely held diffusion model, peripheral sectionalism should decrease following industrialization as regions become integrated into the national society, while functional sectionalism should increase as regions become more economically specialized. Hence, regional political differences are likely to exist both before and after industrialization. An alternate, internal colonial model suggests that peripheral sectionalism is likely to persist despite the effects of industrialization. The adequacy of these models can only be evaluated if these two types of regionalism are empirically differentiated. In this article an indirect method, not employing measures of cultural variables, is presented to distinguish between peripheral and functional sectionalism. Using this method, it is determined that peripheral sectionalism has not decreased following industrialization in the Celtic regions of the diffusion model. It is suggested that this theory is inadequate in its failure to consider the political utility of culture maintenance to groups in peripheral regions."

The correlation coefficients demonstrate that the case-study method which presumably accounts for an innumerable asortment of variables is no more accurate than a simple statistical method which accounts for only two variables. Analysis of the predictions suggests that the case-study method takes behavior segments with known predictive weights and applies other weights which are less efficient. Case-study predictions-at least on the grounds of efficiency-should not be substituted for actuarial predictions. As a complement to the actuarial predictions, the clinical predictions add nothing.

Since the government of county, township, and village exists primarily for farmers, a better approach would seem to be examine the economic status and the psychological equipment of the rural population.

Rural government is at present badly adjusted to its tasks. The general property tax has broken down, population is declining while costs remain stationary, tax delinquency is a permanent problem, and a policy for the wise use of land is yet to be formulated.

Rural attitudes at present do not favor the suggested changes in the direction of permanence, professionalim, and hierarchical organization in governmental services or the adoption of the generally accepted standards of sound administration. An examination of such factors would seem to be more promising than the traditional lines of attack."

Hypotheses developed here refine the way scale competition among generalist organizations is modeled and improve the theoretical development of the sociological bases for the appeal of specialist organizations' products, especially those related to organizational identity. Evidence drawn from qualitative and quantitative research provides strong support for the theory.

It had its origin in the general sectarian movement of post-Reformation Germany. its history and development exhibit a definite sequence of processes, a cycle from assimilation to assimilation. An analysis of these processes throws light upon the evolution of a culture and the problems of social origin and social change. Life-histories supplement this description on the subjective side. The communistic practice of the community seems to have little effect upon family organization, which is predominatly patriarchal. Some evidence of its influence is seen in the field of religion.

In this study the author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, “structural availability” works not only by freeing an actor from conformity‐inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations."

Although such rules emerge without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group’s sense of possibility into the future.

Garnier,American Journal of Sociology,91,2,1985-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 250-280,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Through an analysis of a large survey of employment men and women in France, this article shows that French reproduction theory has overstated the role of education in reproducing class advantage from generation to generation. Among men, reproduction of control over labor power (i.e., managerial/supervisory positions) is primarily direct instead of indirect through education. At the same time, education plays no role in reproducing ownership of businesses (i.e., capitalist and petty bourgeois positions), and there is little tendency for capitalist or petty bourgeois fathers to convert their economic capital into the educational capital for their sons so that the sons can secure managerial positions. Education serves less as a reproducer of class advantage than as a vehicle of mobility into managerial positions. Although reproduction theory has tended to ignore gender differences in class reproduction , these are found to be substantial. In the reproduction of ownership, women are less likely than men to inherit a business from their father. In the reproduction of control over labor power, the considerations that are important to men's chances of acquiring managerial/supervisory positions are generally much less important to women's chances. Thus reproduction strategis that are succesful in perpetuating class privilege for men do not work as well for women."

The resulting SSIC scores are based solely on observed mobility among detailed occupational categories. These scores are quite similar to socioeconomic index (SEI) scores. and somewhat less similar to NORC occupational prestige scores. The SSIC values closely match average offspring's SEIs and average father's SEIs for each category, although no information about SEI or its components is employed in their calculation. This fundamentalist approach to measuring inheritance without a priori scaling reveals that mediation of occupational inheritance by education is outweighed by direct ""ascriptive"" transmission."

In contrast, Merton and his associates, in their studies of medical and law schools, propose that students gradually acquire the self-concept of ""professional."" The issue is important to the theory of adult socialization. Music conservatories afford an excellent test case because music students engage in professional activities while they are still in school. Multivariate analyses of the effects of professional activity and the effects of the music school suggest that both actual professional activity and the professional school itself contribute to the development of a professional selfconcept. But the variables interact. Students who do not engage in ""clinical"" activities (professional work) do not generally acquire a high self-concept. Much of the effect of the music conservatories is not through direct social contacts with teachers or students. Rather, students acquire musical skills which are the prerequisite for professional work and for symbolic rewards, both of which lead to a professional self-concept."

Speaking in terms of collectivity is alluring; but it is description, not explanation. Social organism metaphors, group-mind theories, and the like never lead beyond themselves, nor serve to reveal causation. The group fallacy defined.-This fallacy consists in substituting the group for the individual as a principle of explanation. The group concept may be phrased in either psychological or ""purely social"" terms. Illustrations are drawn from the following fields. I. Social conflict. Freudian repression and dissociation are terms applicable only to individuals. There is a wide divergence of meaning between mental conflict and social conflict. 2. Revolution. Here the fallacy is expressed in such group terms as immobility of society and breakdown of ""social habits."" These terms are merely descriptive, drawing attention away from the truly causal behavior of individuals. 3. The theory of the super-organic. The concept of a causal science on a purely social (non-psychological) plane is untenable, because in all science explanation is possible only by drawing upon the concepts of sciences at more elementary levels. In practice also no one has succeeded in formulating a science of this sort. Culture history is not culture explanation; much less is it an adequate explanation of social change. The true basis for sociology is the social behavior of he socialized individual, in other words, social psychology. The Work of sociology is to describe collectivities of social behavior and social change resulting from it in terms of the group, and to explain these phenomena in terms of the individual."

This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."

This variation is explained by a model of path‐dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work."

This article examines the use of these frames in Renaissance patronage‐seeking letters, both quantitatively (through multidimensional scaling) and qualitatively (using discourse analytical concepts), to present an interactionist approach to the presentation of self and, in turn, to political culture. Writing strategies are only modestly, as actors write from achieved network positions and constantly aim to improve their position, maximize leverage, and build careers through letter writing.   I shall tell you, therefore, first, of what means I made use in order to become an intimate and follower of Gian Galeozzo, the duke of Milan; then I shall tell you how I went about winning the good will of Ladislas, king of Naples; finally I shall recount to you what sort of conduct enabled me to preserve the favor and good will of Pope Giovanni. I think, too, you will be pleased to learn of my various and different devices, my devious and seldom‐used means, which have rarely been described. Thesse are most useful ways to deal with men in civic life; therefore listen well to me. (Alberti 1969, p. 252)   I certainly agree, Lionardo, that the things Piero said all seemed to be wise and sound and full of prudense. His subtlety and considerable artistry were also clear to me…. But it seems to me that I want some other sort of thread and texture in talk on this subject…. You know the truth–how can anyone dream that mere simplicity and goodness will get him friends, or even acquaintancs not actually harmful and annoying?…. The world is amply supplied with fraudulent, false, perfidious, bold, audacious, and rapacious men. Everything in the world is profoundly unsure…. The deal with human wickedness in all its boldness, daring, and greed one must beable to remain constant, temperate, and full of inner strength. These are the qualities I would like to see actually practiced by a man whose friendship I hoped to gain and enjoy…. So there it is; I want to be instructed in this sense concerning friendship, how to obtain it, increase it, diminish it, recover it, and make it permanent. (1969, pp. 264–67)"

This empirical account explains the transition in political communication from norms of secrecy to appeals to public opinion. Popular communicative change in the English Revolution anticipated, in practice, the democratic theory of the public sphere when printing transformed a traditional instrument of communication-the petition. Petitions had medieval origins and traditions that upheld norms of secrecy and privilege in political communication. Economic and technical properties of printing-namely, heightened commercialism and the capacity to reproduce texts-demolished these norms by changing the scope and content of communication by petition. This practical innovation appears in all factions in the revolution. But among radical groups, the political use of printed petitions led to novel theories and to democratic speculation on constitutional provisions that would ensure the authority of public opinion in politics. This analysis contradicts key assumptions on communicative change that fuel pessimistic assessments of the modern public sphere in post-modernism and critical theory."

He is a farmer, architect, statesman, etc., speaking and acting as representative of a type. Or, he may be speaking and acting for the Zeitgeist.

The application of psychology to the study of culture resolves itself to the study of individuals in terms of cultural situations in which individual behavior goes on. From this point of view, the study of culture becomes a problem in the study of cultural types. Adapting biological terminology to our need, we may call them ""variants,"" ""hybrids,"" and ""mutants."" The ""variant"" is a group functionary whose task is to dispose of the accumulating cultural lags by maintaining some degree of consistency between the philosophy and practices prevailing in the group. The""hybrid"" is a form of discontinuous variant whose function is to adapt borrowed culture forms to the prevailing forms in his own group. The ""mutant"" is a genius-leader who conceives his task to be the change of the fundamental pattern of a given culture. Thus do the cultural types, themselves determined by culture, explain the several aspects of the problem of culture change."

This constitutive difficulty presents itself today in ways that have instructive parallels to the problem constellation confronting the first generation of 20th-century sociological classics. Karl Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929) was extraordinarily successful in Germany at the historical turning point of the Weimar Republic. This marks him as a representative figure among those contemporaries who acknowledged the force of ""irrationalist"" criticisms of progressive liberalism but sought to contain the destructive dynamics of such criticisms within a new type of rational framework, both intellectual and political. The article contrasts Mannheim's encounters with antirationalist thought in Ideologie un Utopie with the later pragmatist instrumental rationalism of his writings in English exile. In analyzing the shift, special attention is paid to Mannheim's involvement in Paul Tillich's religious socialist circle and to confrontations between Mannheim and Georg Lukacs, Oscar jaszi, Eduard Heimann, Max Hrkheimer, and Theodor W. Adorno. Newly discovered letters and transcripts are use to specify these relationships. Mannheim's promising theoretical beginnings were disruped by the brute facts of his generation's biography. Learning from Mannheim requires retrieval of his achievements, criticism of its distortions, and renewed start in the direction of his work during the 1920s."

The same process that leads to disapearance of symptoms upon administering a placebo may lead to their emergence if the therapeutic regime promotes it.

But the focus on economic bases of elite opposition has obscured a second issue: co-optation benefits some elites at the expense of those who occupy disadvantaged positions in local patronage networks, inclining the latter to resist. This mechanism accounts for patterns of elite participation in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, a mass mobilization against state building in the postrevolutionary United States. Elites without patronage ties, and those whose clienteles overlapped with those of federal officers, were more likely to mobilize against the state."

The purpose of this study of a random sample of male seniors in an Ivy League college was to ascertain wheter recent social changes and consequent malintegration with regard to sex roles have created stressful repercussions for men as well as for women. It was hypothesized that male seniors would suffer from socially structured scarcity of resources for living up to the norm of masculine intellectual superiority in their relationships with female friends who are also college students of nearly the same age. This hypothesis was confirmed for one-third of the sample. An explanation for the adjustment of the majority is supported by data from the study. The male attitudes toward their future marital roles are replete with inconsistencies. Underlying the inconsistencies are some basic conflicts of interests and of norms. Much of the ideology wich buttressed the traditional sex role differentiations in marriage has been undermined, but the belief that the husband must be the superior achiever in the occupational world and the wife the caretaker of young children, is still deeply rooted."

Evidence concerning the social origins of physicians in Thailand was collected from 1934 to 1966 and from a questionnaire survey administered to 666 male students in 1966. For the past four decades the medical profession has been accessible almost exclusively to the children of the elite classes. Despite this class closure, the expansion of the medical profession is linked with a substantial increase in status mobility from families that own commercial shops. This movement from the bourgeoisie into the government bureaucracy indicates the relevance of Weber's theory of patrimonial authority for comparative analysis."

His more important contributions are: (I) the demonstration that evolutionary doctrine does not sanction political quietism and laissez faire; (2) a clarification of the concept of liberty through a discriminating classification of the various types of liberty; (3) a defense of democracy, though admitting its many efects in its present undeveloped form; (4) the proof that a democratic system must embrace social and economic, as well as political, democracy; (5) the thesis that militarism and imperialism are fundamentally opposed to democracy, and that the problems of modern society resolve themselves into an application of our social science and our accumulated intelligence to the task of reconstructing nor only internal social, economic, and political conditions, but also international relations. His social philosophy is the ost effective English substantiation of Lester F. Ward's notion of social telesis."

It may signal aggresive or dominating intent, as in a staredown, or it may convey an impression of close bonding, intimacy, or a request for aid, depending on how actors define the situation. Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers."

In the days of serfdom the landlord and government dealt with the often remote commune as a unit. With the coming of emancipation a form of local government was instituted known as the Zemstvo, the peasants forming a sort of electoral college whose deputies selected district representatives from candidates proffered by the provincial governonr. The October Revolution found the villages taking over the estates of the landlords, the land theoretically belonging to the state and being divided impartially by a local committee. The pyramidal structure of the Soviet state rests upon the peasant and worker but not equally. Suffrage is extended to every worker over eighteen with few exceptions. Elections for representatives are held once a year; the slate is prepared by the party nucleus. Elections are very informal. The council elects delegates to the county soviet, and that body in turn to the state soviet, and so on to Moscow. The local group divides itself into commissions to deal with the village affairs. Informality holds in matters of the court, justice in local affairs moves considerately, and there are no subtleties of law. The center of the cultural and social activities of the village is the ""People's House,"" and practically every village boasts its public playground and football field. These social leavens have been set to work in the remotest villages. All village activities are based on local autonomy, but party members from the city volunteer to live in the villages and are expected to participate in all village affairs."

These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual‐level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data‐gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations."

Three central contingencies of an initial metamorphosis, from sober dispositions to doing laughter, are specified. The would-be laugher must collaboratively construct the presumption that another person shares his or her perspective on the mirror's reflections, develop mutually untenable definitions of a person and that person's reflections, and display a corporeal appreciation of the sensed juxtaposition. Each of these dimensions is altered when participants undergo a second metamorphosis, a shift to being done by the spirit raised. A final section analyzes the trascendent powers of family relations as they play on glaces bizarres."

He opposed the program to level art to the comprehension of the proletarian, holding that the new freedom would raise the standards and multiply the interests of the workers. His was a militant attack on the concept of a proletarian culture. A sharp opposition to him has developed, Lunacharsky insisting that at least in a transition stage a distinctive class art was necessary. Other bolshevik critics have opposed his position. While events in the development of the art of Russia have confirmed the position of his opponents, Trotsky's contribution to sociological aesthetics remains highly significant."
