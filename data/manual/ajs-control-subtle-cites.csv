Swann Harding,American Journal of Sociology,41,4,1936-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 492-503,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The social sciences are not more difficult or complex than the physical and natural sciences. In all the sciences the forces and phenomena are infinite in number, complicated, elusive, diverse. The method is alike in all: the workers create causes to explain observed events. There must be abstraction with the assumption that certain axioms are true unproved and that certain factors do not vary or else are negligible in effect. In physics and biology, however, the workers have shown more tendency to agree upon the use of hypotheses, axioms, specific methods, classification, mathematics, and logic than have workers in the social sciences. The scientific worker is always himself part and parcel of the material with which he works. Objectivity, exactitude, and certitude are always but very relatively attained."

Creegan,American Journal of Sociology,50,5,1945-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 386-389,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The weakness of social psychology has been its lack of a clearly defined field of operation. It is defined here as the sociology of personal behavior, that is, as the study of the social rationale of personal behavior. For personal policy is determined, and seldom deliberately, with reference to values rather than to logic alone. Social values constitute the points of reference whereby individual behavior acquires some consistency over and above the consistency of subjective tastes. As an example we may note the status-referent rationale of many personal expressive actions in western European culture."

Williamson,American Journal of Sociology,87,3,1981-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 548-577,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The transaction cost approach to the study of economic organization regards the transaction as the basic unit of analysis and holds that an understanding of transaction cost economizing is central to the study of organizations. Applications of this approach require that transactions be dimensionalized and that alternative governance structures be described. Economizing is accomplished by assigning transactions to governance structures in a discriminating way. The approach applies both to the determination of efficient boundaries, as between firms and markets, and to the organization of internal transactions, including the design of employment relations. The approach is compared and contrasted with selected parts of the organization theory literature."

Mackaye,American Journal of Sociology,35,3,1929-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 353-368,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Both the methods of intelligence testing and classroom experiences indicate that ""intelligence,"" as the word is used in education, refers to abilities identical or highly correlated with speech functions. Experience provides two signs of this correlation in a quantitative sense-differing abilities in storing up words for use and differing abilities in handling quantities of verbal terms at one time. The quantitative limit may be ascertained by tests calling for word reproduction without the stimulus of a running idea. A further test reveals two types of qualitative response in the high-quantity testing group, indicating that differing behavior responses in different individuals may be based on concepts of great differences in clarity but resulting from the same word-stimulus. Difficulty in rapidly summing up relationships between words in the same run of thought creates a difficulty in handling words as symbols of ideas in place. There is a suggestion that these differences are not innate, but result from exposure to differing social environment, which education does not attempt to overcome. Success of a democracy may be intimately related to speech functions, to the extent that twilight zones of speech-that is, zones stimulating vivid rather than clear concepts-are found in different parts of the vocabulary scale in different individuals."

The social-interactionist school of social psychology has countered with a re-emphasis upon the symbolic and communicatory processes and also with a methodological protest against mere mechanical measurement and testing at the expense of sociological interpretation and sympathetic insight. Both schools have contributed toward the growth on an autonomous schience of social psychology."

I approach this question by considering the applicability of the perspectives on modern society of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber to the United States. Arguing that it is perhaps Weber who is of greatest heuristic worth in interpreting American society because of his sensitivity to the Protestant ethos, I illustrate this line of analysis by drawing attention to two major Puritan cultural themes: ""wilderness"" and ""voluntarism."""

Regulation of the mechanics of trading in the interest of more efficient functioning has long been carried on by the exchange itself. This type of control has been augmented and improved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any regulation of the exchange which would destroy the principle of the free competitive market, however, would run directly counter to the most important values of contemporary society. Such drastic control would threaten the basic complex of private property and hence would be fundamentally ineffectual."

Study of the lives of the individual achievers as well as the parishes in which they were born and educated indicates that education was the key to achievement and that most of the achievers came from urban areas, were born into the upper middle class, attended university, and lived longer thant the average person. In sum, the eighteenth-century Scottish achiever seems to resemble his twentieth-century counterpart in many ways."

It is a system of high-powered mental telepathy which held that matter could be spiritualized and brough under the complete domination of though, and, conversity, that all thoughts become matter. It appeared as a concerted movement in 1890 and by 1915 had achieved a prodigious growth. It had no church and was essentially a metropolitan religion. Its adherents were impelled mainly by the motive of profit, and few were masters of its theology and metaphysics. Like Puritanism, it recognized the law of prosperity as a cardinal statute. By personal magnetism the adherent could attract, persuade, influence, or control his fellows, and success in business was assured. The writings of New Thought accord with the traditional American philosophy of success. They banish luck and reaffirm the economic potency of character. Faith in equality of opportunity is sustained. The bulk of the literature contains little but esoteric directions for making money. The very novelty of New Though gave it popularity."

Theoretical analysis focuses on gendering of health‐related behavior, the time needed to promote a spouse's salubrious behavior, and the effects of work hours on the availability of time for nonwork activities. Empirical analyses are based on 1986 and 1989 longitudinal U.S. data. Fewer than 40 hours of work per week by wives has no effect on husbands’ health, but more than 40 hours has substantial negative effect. Long work hours by husbands are not detrimental to wives’ health. Wives’ work hours shows no effect on their own health, but husbands’ work hours show strong positive effect on their own health. Methodological issues are considered."

Allowing for a variety of other factors, the author assesses whether experimental changes, variously defined, had a common effect that could be regarded as a pure result of the experimentation. The main conclusion is that these data show slender or no evidence of a Hawthorne effect."

Such an elite is seen to profit through the increasing intensification of the land use of the area in which its members hold a common interest. An elite competes with other land-based elites in an effort to have growth-inducing resources invested within its own area as opposed to that of another. Governmental authority, at the local and nonlocal levels, is utilized to assist in achieving this growth at the expense of competing localities. Conditions of community life are largely a consequence of the social, econimic, and political forces embodied in this growth machine. The relevance of growth to the interests of various social groups is examined in this context, particularly with reference to the issue of unemployment. Recent social trends in opposition to growth are described and their potential consequences evaluated."

It represents a case study in isolation and accommodation, and indicates the processes involved in the formation and development of local communities in city life. The natural history of this institution shows that it developed as a gradual and undesigned adaptation to a strage habitat and culture, and its disintegration proceeds independent of legal enactment. The Jews, in so far as they are a separate ethnic group, are a product of ghetto life, which accounts for the reappearance of the ghetto wherever Jews settle in large numbers. The modern ghetto in its location and structure is determined by the unique status of the Jew and by his traditions. His neighbors in the new world tend to be the same as in the old. Eastern ghettos differ from those of the West in that the latter generally have as many local areas of settlement as there are waves of immigrants. As the Jew becomes conscious of his subordinate position in the ghetto he flees, but he is pursued by fellow-Jew until his new habitat assumes the atmosphere of the ghetto itself. In the course of his migration, his personality changes as the culture of his group fuses with that of the larger world outside."

This ecology nurtured many close–knit student networks, as well as directly exposed all Beijing students to a collective action environment when the movement started. These ecological conditions not only sustained a high rate of movement participation but also facilitated the formation of many ecology–dependent strategies of student mobilization, which in turn patterned the dynamics of the movement."

Under French traditions, teaching and public administration are highly professionalized, offering distinctive opportunities for women.

The contrast between potential and actual professional achievement has not led to ""feminist"" counter-ideologies. This situation is analyzed in terms of national and class values defining the nature of women, of high culture, and the relationship between government and society. The professional achievements of French women, although comparatively substantial, are interpreted as constrained and ambiguous."

Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women’s underinvestment in firm‐specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm‐specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high‐skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women’s disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand‐side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women.

The all-Negro community in Oklahoma was conceived as a social experiment. It is an attempt by Negroes to escape the psychological pressures experienced in racially mixed southern communities. A ""pattern of avoidance"" characterizes the basic racial attitudes of the residents of these communities. There are, however, certain differences between upper and lower classes in the expression of attitudes. Nevertheless, all residents, completely assimilated into the societal structure of the all-Negro society, are quite self-conscious of the eculiarities of their culture."

Particularly promising here is ""dual exchange theory,"" as represented in Ekeh's elaboration of Levi-Strauss's conception of elementary exchange. Using data from a small-scale ethnographic study of social network mobilization among low-income black women in the event of job loss, this paper investigates two tenets of dual exchange theory: (1) informal support exchanges in natural settings take the form of ""generalized"" and ""restricted"" exchange, and (2) generalized exchange systems are associated with greater degrees of solidarity and social support. The data support the dual exchange thesis, with some modification of Ekeh's dichotomized conceptualization of exchange. The Study reinforces the utility of network analysis and exchange concepts in the analysis of social support."

Garnier,American Journal of Sociology,91,2,1985-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 250-280,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Through an analysis of a large survey of employment men and women in France, this article shows that French reproduction theory has overstated the role of education in reproducing class advantage from generation to generation. Among men, reproduction of control over labor power (i.e., managerial/supervisory positions) is primarily direct instead of indirect through education. At the same time, education plays no role in reproducing ownership of businesses (i.e., capitalist and petty bourgeois positions), and there is little tendency for capitalist or petty bourgeois fathers to convert their economic capital into the educational capital for their sons so that the sons can secure managerial positions. Education serves less as a reproducer of class advantage than as a vehicle of mobility into managerial positions. Although reproduction theory has tended to ignore gender differences in class reproduction , these are found to be substantial. In the reproduction of ownership, women are less likely than men to inherit a business from their father. In the reproduction of control over labor power, the considerations that are important to men's chances of acquiring managerial/supervisory positions are generally much less important to women's chances. Thus reproduction strategis that are succesful in perpetuating class privilege for men do not work as well for women."

Consequently there are those who regard it as a wholly uscientific procedure. Sometimes they claim that the language of ""motives and goals"" is itself unscientific, but this is a dogmatic and metaphysical limitation of the realm of science. More plausibly they claim that since motives are baffling and unverifiable they lie outside the scope of scientific investigation. But this claim goes too far, since motives manifest themselves in various evidential ways, and science may properly examine the bearing of the evidences, even where certainty is not attainable. The moral is not that we abandon the investigation of motives-for they are intimate data of human experience-but that we make the recognition of difficulties the basis for more thorough investigation."

Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change."

Each was previously formalized within a common biased-net mathematical framework. These two formalizations are integrated within a single approach to the study of social relations. Blau's theory is associated with quantities such as heterogeneity, consolidation, and a bias parameter pertaining to homophily. Granovetter's principle is formalized in terms of another bias parameter pertaining to the likelihood of relational closure in triads. A concluding discussion examines empirical literature on diffusion processes to see if hypotheses implied by the unified theory are supported by evidence."

The supervisory styles were arrayed on two continuums: the close versus general and the punitive versus non-punitive. Close as compared with general supervision produced significant increases in aggressive feelings toward the supervisor and in indirect aggression toward the supervisor through lowered productivity, an insignificant increase in verbal aggression toward the supervisor, and an increase of borderline significance in aggressive feelings toward co-workers. Punitive as compared with non-punitive supervision produced significant increases in indirect aggression through lowered productivity and in verbal aggression, but no significant increases in aggression toward co-workers. The relationship between close supervision and aggresive feelings appears to be mediated by the self-esteem of the subordinate; an increase in aggresive feelings occurred only in subjects having low self-esteem. Finally, the combined effect of the close and punitive supervision dimensions, for both aggressive feelings and indirect aggression, was not a simple function, but was less than would be predicted on the basis of additive assumptions."

As the usual static consideration of balance predicts, students recognize and like others who are near them, both in physical distance (proximity) and in college class (peership). Most important, however-if little tested-are the dynamic aspects of balance whose evaluation requires tracing individual pairs through time. Doing this shows that between room-mates and others living near to one another, attraction changes less when it is initially high; between those more distant, attraction changes less when initially low. Thus, for everyone, attraction is more stable. Over the dormitory's first four years, similitary of physical location and of college class continues to predict attraction; but between more proximate persons, prediction declines in later years, as frienships increasingly span distance and class."

As interest shifted from physical structures and traits to social relations and processes, the natural history of race relations was outlined; racial prejudice was seen as a subjective aspect of interrupted racial processes; impersonal factors and processes were isolated; and the analysis of marginality gave an understanding of differential racial status within and among racial groups. The present need is for study of collective behavior in relation to personality development and racial change."

Individuals choose whether to innovate or imitate, and in the latter case, from whom to learn. The probabilities of these possible actions respond to an individual’s past experiences using reinforcement learning. Among some of the authors’ more interesting findings is that a population’s performance is not monotonically increasing in either the reliability of the communication network or the productivity of innovation."

Lindesmith,American Journal of Sociology,43,4,1938-01-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 593-613,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Current theories of drug addiction tend to be moralistic rather than scientific. Any satisfactory theory must attempt to account for the fact that the repeated administration of opiates sometimes is followed by addition and sometimes is not. The factor which accounts for this differential effect appears to be the person's knowledge or belief, supplied him by his cultural milieu, concerning the nature of the distress that accompanies the sudden cessation of the opiate. If he fails to realize the connection between this distress and the opiate he escapes addiction, whereas if he attributes the discomfort to the opiate and thereafter uses the opiate to alleviate it he invariably becomes addicted. Addiction is generated in the process of using the drug consciously to alleviate withdrawal distress. No exceptions to this theory could be found. It is confirmed by analysis of certain aspects of addict argot and by the consideration of certain types of crucial cases. The theory provides a simple means of accounting for many aspects of the habit. It is methodologically significant in that it is based upon case data and is at the same time universal in form and subject to definite verification or disproof."

If so, How? Data on the occurrence of conflicts and of violence against various ethnic or racial groups in the 81 largest cities, 1880-1914, show that the growth of the union movement and the rising supply of low-wage labor increased levels of ethnic competition in urban labor markets, thus raising rates of ethnic comflict. The findings support the argument that ethnic conflict and labor unrest are parallel forms of collective action and that each depends on the number and foundings of national labor unions. The effect of labor union organization is strongest for all attacks on blacks. In addition, sharp increases in immigration, a downturn in economic fortunes, and contagion processes all raise rates of ethnic conflict."

It is maintained that a use of the technique will provide a desirable balance between the more purely behavioristic type of investigation and the type which seeks some measure of insight into the ""meanings"" current in the community. The investigator, forced to analyze his own roles, is, on the one hand, less misled by the myth of complete objectivity in social research and, on the other, more consciously aware of his own biases."

In particular, we discuss (a) embeddability, or how to determine whether observations on an empirical process could have arisen via the evolution of a continuous-time Markov structure; and (b) identification, or what to do if the observations are consisten with more than one continuous-time Markov structure. With respect to the latter topic, we discuss how to select the specific structure from the list of alternatives which should be associated with the empirical process. We point out that the issues of embeddability and identification are especially pertinent to modeling empirical processes when one has available only fragmentary data and when the observations contain ""noise"" or other sources of error. These characteristics, of course, describe the typical work situation of sociologists. Finally, we note the type of situation in which a continuous-time model is the proper structure to employ and indicate that issues analogus to the ones we describe here apply to modeling social processes with discrete-time structure."

Since urban and rural areas differ in the distribution of private and public places, with denser public places in cities, police practice in urban and rural areas is different. And crimes of different types are systematically distributed; some, like murder, are almost entirely committed in private places, and others, such as traffic offenses, entirely in public. Statistics on arrest and conviction rates for different types of crime show the influence of the social location of the types of crime on the differential character of police practice. Too, the structural characteristics of subsections of police departments are derived from the social location of the type of crime the subsection deals with. Hypotheses on the effects of introducing new crimes into the responsibilities of different subsections of police department are outlined for future research."

The historical pattern of ""backyard"" residence, which emerged in the ante bellum Sout under slavery, has apparently survived into the present, dispite the passage of a hundred years. Even when other relevant variables are controlled, there continues to be a negative association between age of the city and current level of segregation."

Drawing on structural and organizational theories of the workplace, the authors demonstrate how organizational conditions affect workers’ and regulatory agents’ understandings of unlawful discrimination. Using a national sample of work establishments, matched to discrimination‐charge data obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the authors examine how characteristics of the workplace and institutional environment affect variation in the incidence of workers’ charges of sex and race discrimination and in the subset of discrimination claims that are verified by EEOC investigators. The findings indicate that workplace conditions, including size, composition, and minority management, affect workers’ charges as well as verified claims; the latter are also affected by institutional factors, such as affirmative action requirements, subsidiary status, and industrial sector. These results suggest that internal workplace conditions affect both workers’ and regulatory agents’ interpretations of potentially discriminatory experiences, while institutional conditions matter only for regulatory agents’ interpretations of those events."

The themes of process is identified as being central to this orientation. Major criticisms of the approach are considered, and several levels of analysis on which the reactions emphasis is useful are outlined. Brief consideration is given to some of the theoretical antecedents of the reactions orientation-leading to the conclusion that, at its heart, the approach simply develops, applies, and organizes some central themes of general sociological analysis as they relate to deviance and social control. While the approach probably does not constitute a causal theory in the strict sense of the term, its strong grounding in traditional sociological perspectives suggests that it has great promise in advancing theoretical integration in the area of deviance analysis."

While severe state repression is expected to lead to generalized demobilization, these cases reveal that repression may directly stimulate collective action. The potential for sustained collective action in high‐risk contexts depends upon the relationship between strategies of repression and the particular configuration of embedded social networks; it is more likely where dense yet diverse interpersonal networks are embedded within broader national and transnational institutional and issue networks."

Beginning in the late 1970s, these cultural norms came into direct confrontation with the state birth control policy. Pitched against each other are the antinatalist laws backed by the powerful and unyielding state apparatus on the one side and the ancient pronatalist norms backed by revived lineage networks on the other. Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict."

Age, income, education, and absence of children must be discarded as explanatory factors of success in marriage in the present sample. A negatively skewed curve is probably normal for distribution of marital satisfaction, but this skewness is exaggerated in the present study by the instrument used and by psychological selective factors. The Appendix suggests that a periodic relationship may obtain between number of years' duration of marriage and marital satisfaction; that a parabolic relationship exists between the difference in age of the spouses and marital satisfaction; that a negative relationship may exist between age of men at marriage and their marital satisfaction; and that the first child is more of a disturbing factor with men than the second child."

Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the globalization of bankruptcy law has proceeded through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law."

Plato did not regard The Republic as a treatise on political science or sociology but as an inquiry in moral philosophy.

Building off theories of temporality and action, the authors map three different modes of future making—protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes—that actors need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms through which other theoretical or empirical constructs—such as racism or late modernity—operate; and open a window into the ways in which people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its own right."

A mesolevel network is a social network that differs in three important respects from interpersonal microlevel networks directly linking prior and potential adopters of a practice to one another: (1) it is generated by a different causal process than the microlevel network; (2) it tends to be much sparser than the microlevel network; and (3) the typical edge of a mesolevel network bridges much longer sociometric and geographic distances than the typical edge of a microlevel network. These types of mesolevel networks are important because they can dramatically influence the speed at which a contagious practice will diffuse. The mesolevel network focused upon in this article is the network that emerged out of the travel routes of political agitators affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. Computational modeling shows that the diffusion of the Social Democratic Party is likely to have been considerably influenced by the structure of this network. Empirical analyses of the founding of party organizations during the period 1894–1911 support these theoretical predictions and suggest that this mesolevel network was of considerable importance for the diffusion of the Swedish Social Democratic Party."

The effect on the biological functions of the family has been indirect, the result of the changed economic functions of the family. In the near future the biological functions of the family may be affected directly by important discoveries in the rapidly developing field of the biology of sex and reproduction.

Holding these multiple negatively evaluated statuses has meant that black women have clustered at the very bottom of most strata. This paper explores the patterns leading to success of a small minority of black women who have managed to work in occupations of high rank. It points to the special factors which have not only canceled the negative effect of holding statuses of low rank, but which have produced a positive and facilitating context for career. Among these are the models in the black community of women as ""doers""; the support of extended kin in assisting women with family responsibilities; pressure on black women to be economically productive and financially independent; and a number of other conditions leading to self-confidence and autonomy."

Our data falsify the hormone transfer hypothesis by isolating a single condition that eliminates the opposite‐sex twin effect we observe—the presence of an older same‐sex sibling. We also consider and reject a speculative evolutionary theory that rests on observing birth‐order effects on same‐sex orientation. In contrast, our results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same‐sex romantic preferences."

The study’s key theoretical insight is that the organizational decoupling required for successful commercialization may complicate companies’ ability to gain employee acceptance. Rich ethnographic data from Motherhood, Inc., an organization offering support and services for new mothers, is leveraged to identify two conditions under which employee resistance may arise and undermine successful commercialization. This article contributes to sociological understandings by theorizing the important role of employees in commercialization and to organizational theory more generally by specifying conditions under which decoupling may be difficult to achieve."

Most of the evidence, however, is hidden because sociologists generally (1) fail to differentiate kinds of theoretical activity, (2) focus almost exclusively on growth by means of increasing empirical support, and (3) ignore the variety of theoretical contexts within which growth can occur. Distinguishing among orienting strategies (i.e., metatheoretical frameworks), unit theories (individual theoretical arguments), and theoretical research programs (sets of interrelated theories) helps overcome these obstacles. A focus on programs reveals five types of relations among theories. Three types represent basic forms of theoretical growth; the other two are more specialized forms which usually emerge only in the context of programs based on one of the three basic types. These ideas are first explicated and then applied to several cases of ongoing theoretical activity in sociology. Such cases provide models or exemplars (in the Kuhnian sense) of theoretical growth. Detailed analysis of these exemplars should promote significant growth in other branches of sociology."

The ""structural"" and sociological analysis in his major work, Political Parties, developed within the categories and norms of Weberian social science. However, substantive disagreement arose over the central ""problematic"" of modern social theory: for Michels it was ""democracy,"" for Weber ""domination."" This disagreement accounts for their contrasting interpretations of the organizational phenomenon. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the import of Weber's critique."

The impression of two kinds of neuroses-symptom neuroses and character neuroses-which resulted from this new conception is again misleading, for every neurosis is essentially a character disorder. This view introduces social viewpoints into a field claimed by medical psychiatry. From a social standpoint a neurosis can be defined as a deviation from the ""normal"" in the sense of the statistically average in a given culture. From a clinical viewpoint neuroses may be regarded as an attempt to cope with life under difficult internal conditions which center about a basic anxiety toward life in general. An attempt to bridge the difference between the socially oriented definition of neurosis and that which is clinically oriented would describe a neurosis as a deviation from the average but add that the deviation does not primarily concern the manifest behavior but the quantity or quality of basic anxiety as well as that of the deviation developed for the sake of security."

Brain morphology and pigmentation are the most popular criteria of racial differentiation, but neither of these seems to be dependable. The monogenetic origin of races is commonly held by anthropologists. If this be true, it is migration, regional segregation, and environmental selection that explain anatomical, physiological, and pathological peculiarities of ""racial"" groups. But, in the last analysis, race differences are defensible only in a certain special sense. For the hybridization of races is an acknowledged fact. Racial differences turn out to be cultural differences, and these-in view of the constant re-adaptation of borrowed culture forms to the specific demands of pre-existing cultures-are anything but pure. Competition and migration, mobility and dominance, segregation and selection may be regarded as stages in the development of culture groups. In the light of this analysis the concept of racial superiority appears to be highly artificial. The real significance of the term ""race"" lies in its employment as a culture symbol of group conflict and group organization."

Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit‐based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace."

Hutchins' thesis that since theology cannot furnish a unifying principle for modern education, metaphysics should be employed for this purpose. Both parties to the debate agree on the need, and agree that the only question here is which of these two disciplines should supply it. Both refer to conditions in the Middle Ages as in some sense an ideal and a model. This review points out that in so far as there was unity of belief in the Middle Ages it rested on some direct compulsion with more of compulsive conditioning and still more general ignorance, which also was partly imposed, but was chiefly due to the limitations of the culture as a whole. It is argued that history and common sense unite in proving that ""theology"" must claim the right to control men's thinking coercively, and must do so as far as it can find effective means. The first step in unifying anything else by means of theology or metaphysics must be to unify the doctrinal field in question itself. From this point of view the difference between the two fields disappears; unity means the imposition of some particular theology by force. The ideal of social thought and education unified in terms of philosophical principles universally accepted is admittely appealing, intellectually and aesthetically. But the history of Christendom since the Middle Ages seems to prove two things: (1) that it is impossible to have agreement on theology (or metaphysics) without coercion, and probably impossible with it; (2) that is unnecessary to have such agreement in order to have social co-operation both more humane and far more effective than any ever seen under any system or social order based on official control of thinking. This is true in spite of the fact that freedom seems to involve much difference of opinion about ultimate questions, which is in a sense ""disorderly."" In conclusion, it is suggested that the only means to intellectual unity which is either possible or morally defensible in the discovery and dispassionate promulgation of ""truth,"" the ""right"" answers to the questions at issue."

When trying to explain the causes of these behaviors, however, many social scientists typically resort to the idea of ""pathological"" origins. On the whole, social scientists have yet to explain how and why ""normal"" individuals operating in unexceptional social environments deviate and commit crimes, Recent developments in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology provide new insights that promise to explain how deviance and crime arise naturally in populations of interacting individuals without necessarily implying genetic influences. We interpret criminal behaviors by which offenders expropriate goods or services from others as expressions of diverse behavioral strategies that derive from normal patterns of population-level social organization and interaction. This views accommodates both explanations that focus on individual causes of crime and those directed toward social factors. Our approach permits the generation of novel hypotheses and fully accommodates, simplifies, and helps unify important and diverse insights and findings amassed by a wide range of disciplines and theories that have tried to account for the nature and distribution of crime."

In the present study this deficiency is overcome. The characteristics of neighborhood organizations in Seattle, Washington, in 1929 and in 1979 are compared, focusing on the neighborhood level and taking an institutional approach. Two sets of hypotheses about the organizations-the first dealing with changes in resident participation and the second with changes in functional orientation-are derived from the natural-and limited-community models. In general, the analysis provides mixed support for the hypotheses. The data indicate a clear trend toward a more exclusively political emphasis among Seattle neighborhoods but cast doubt on the simple ""gemeinschaft"" characterization of these areas at an earlier point in time. A major conclusion of the study is that, if the decline-of-community thesis is to give an accurate description of the transformation in urban neighborhood life during the past half-century, the natural-community model should be revised."

This is especially true for initial courtship encounters when pairs report a sense of interpersonal chemistry. The authors explore the process of romantic bonding by applying interaction ritual theory, extended and integrated with methods from computational linguistics, to the study of courtship encounters and, specifically, heterosexual speed dating. The authors find that the assortment of interpersonal moves associated with a sense of connection characterizes a conventionalized form of initial courtship activity. The game is successfully played when females are the point of focus and engaged in the conversation and males demonstrate alignment with and understanding of the female. In short, initial heterosexual courtship encounters are associated with a sense of bonding when they reflect a reciprocal asymmetrical performance in which differentiated roles are mutually coordinated."

Speaking in terms of collectivity is alluring; but it is description, not explanation. Social organism metaphors, group-mind theories, and the like never lead beyond themselves, nor serve to reveal causation. The group fallacy defined.-This fallacy consists in substituting the group for the individual as a principle of explanation. The group concept may be phrased in either psychological or ""purely social"" terms. Illustrations are drawn from the following fields. I. Social conflict. Freudian repression and dissociation are terms applicable only to individuals. There is a wide divergence of meaning between mental conflict and social conflict. 2. Revolution. Here the fallacy is expressed in such group terms as immobility of society and breakdown of ""social habits."" These terms are merely descriptive, drawing attention away from the truly causal behavior of individuals. 3. The theory of the super-organic. The concept of a causal science on a purely social (non-psychological) plane is untenable, because in all science explanation is possible only by drawing upon the concepts of sciences at more elementary levels. In practice also no one has succeeded in formulating a science of this sort. Culture history is not culture explanation; much less is it an adequate explanation of social change. The true basis for sociology is the social behavior of he socialized individual, in other words, social psychology. The Work of sociology is to describe collectivities of social behavior and social change resulting from it in terms of the group, and to explain these phenomena in terms of the individual."

More recent research indicates that Israeli teachers tend to generalize the characteristics of ethnic origin so that Orientals are considered less capable intellectually and motivationally to such an extent that their handicaps are irreversible. Using the framework of expectation-states theory, this study proposes that these prevailing tendencies are an inevitable consequence of the functioning of ethnicity as a diffuse status. This interpretation suggest that ethnic prejudice in Israel is a relatively general phenomenon, not limited to the schooling process. The proposition is examined in the context of achievement in professional soccer, where intellectual prerequisites are less demanding. The findings support the proposition, showing similar patterns of ethnic inequality in terms of both actual achievement and the operation of status generalization. The Israeli case suggests that an egalitarian ideology and policies of ethnic integration cannot effectively prevent emerging inequalities so long as ethnicity functions as a diffuse status."

This thesis challenges those theories which claim that the importance of class conflicts declined under state socialism and that therefore such societies should be described as containing nonantagonistic classes or strata. It also challenges the critical theories which acknowledge the existence of a new dominant class in Eastern Europe, but which describe that class as the bureaucracy or technobureaucracy. This paper attempts to base its class analysis on the exploration of the mechanisms and institutions of expropriation of surplus under state socialism. It is suggested that in contemporary Eastern Europe private ownership and market mechanisms of expropriation have been replaced by central planning and redistribution of the economic surplus. All those who have vested interests in the maximization of redistributive power are members of a new dominating class. If we define the new class this way it will include more than just the bureaucracy; potentially, it includes the whole intelligentsia. The paper describes the new dominant class of intelligentsia as a class in statu nascendi. The formation of this class takes a whole historical epoch. In the first stage of state-socialist development the Djilas thesis is basically accurate: under Stalinism and in the early post-Stalinist years the bureaucracy had the monopoly of power. During the last two decades, on the other hand, the social base of power holders has broadened, especially in those countries which experimented with economic and political reforms. The formation of a new dominant class which incorporates the whole of the intelligentsia is now under way."

But the college-related protests and the wider public disechantment have sharply different characteristics: they have peaked at different points in the war; they are discontinous in educational and age basis; and a substantial part of the antiwar public is also extremely hostile toward college protesters. Together these findings suggest a distinction between moral criticisms of the goals and nature of the war and pragmatic disillusionment over failure to win it. This hypothesized distinction is investigated using thematic analysis of open-ended responses from a cross-section sample of 1,263 Detroit adults who had indicated opposition to American intervention in Vietnam. A small classroom sample of University of Michigan students is also used for comparison purposes. The themes emphasized by the Detroit sample as a whole, and by most subcategories defined in terms of race, sex, age, and education, are generally consistent with the moral-pragmatic distinction. Other related factors (such as traditional isolationism) are also shown to contribute to broader public disenchantment with the war. The moral-pragmatic distinction, while somewhat oversimplified, is useful in considering public reactions to future wars of the same general type."

It is argued that social exchange produces positive or negative global feelings, which are internally rewarding or punishing. The theory indicates that social units (relations, groups, networks) are perceived as a source of these feelings, contingent on the degree of jointness in the exchange task. The jointness of the task is greatest if (1) actors find it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on or contributions to solving the exchange task (nonseparability) and (2) actors perceive a shared responsibility for success or failure at the exchange task. The theory explicates the effects of different exchange structures on these conditions and, in turn, on cohesion and solidarity. Implications are developed for network‐to‐group transformations."

The political preferences, information, prejudices, and convictions of 375 undergraduates were studied. By methods of correlation and of comparing extreme groups in respect to scholarship, prejudice, and radicalism, the existence of types is discovered. The most prominent types are those showing radicalism with high scholarship and low prejudice, and conservatism with low scholarship and high prejudice. Those who feel strongly on political matters, the Catholics, the Jews, and those who differ in vote from their fathers also show distinctive political and personal qualities. The study discovers the hierarchy of prejudice for the group as a whole; the leading bias is antisocialistic. Several practical conclusions for politics are offered. The principal theoretical conclusion is that political behavior is not specific, but is related to inclusive sets or attitudes in personality. The political character of men is, on the whole, bound up with many generic traits in their personalities."

At the basis of whatever cultural uniqueness the South has is the institution of the plantation. From the point of view of the educational process, plantation societies may be compared with agricultural mission societies. The plantation and the agricultural mission have different histories and conflicting ideologies, but they developed in similar environments; and in adjusting to the permanent elements in the environment, like geography and climate, they eventually become very similar institutions. The educational process in each goes about as far as,and not much further than, the needs of the situation require. And the needs are, or have been, about the same. The comparison suggest that education is fundamentally a process of biological adaptation and survival. But an education which has sufficied for relatively simple world in which both the plantation and the mission developed will not suffice for competition in the more complex and uncertain order into which the world is moving."

A change in any one factor of the environment brings about a complete change in the milieu, and man is a part of the processes by which the balance of the region is maintained or shifted. The permanence of civilization depends on man's understanding of, and co-operation with, the totality of the region's forces. The law of diminishing returns is part of a wider law of the exhaustion of the store of nature when man destroys the established cycle of the region's life-processes. Where man has torn the web of life nature seeks to repair it through a reduction of the population to numbers that the ecologic balance may permit. Many countries have adopted a standard of consumption with little reference to the resources. Science must comprehend the web of relations between human life and organic and inorganic nature and reveal the relation between cause and effect between man's activities and the remote phases of transformation in nature's life processes."

It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965–99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions."

Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after controlling neighborhood structural characteristics. Collective efficacy is also linked to lower rates of violent crime after accounting for disorder and the reciprocal effects of violence. Contrary to the ""broken windows"" theory, however, the relationship between public disorder and crime is spurious except perhaps for robbery."

Communications drawn from the movement's official journal provide comprehensive data for identifying and interpreting the movement narratives of race and class.

Structural explanation is described as an alternative. Umberto Eco's idea of a semantic encyclopedia is used as the basis of an illustration which is set forth in contrast to a formalist (Blau) and an interpretativist (Bittner/Garfinkel) theory of social structures. The argument rests upon the assumption that, because measurement is the encodement of what sociologists call observations, structuralist semiotics can be employed to provide an explanation for the language of measurement that depends on a semantics of social structures as such."

This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."

The author analyzes the effects of hierarchical (superior‐subordinate) and horizontal (friendship and co‐working) networks on “participation shifts”—transitions in the identities of speakers and targets (addressees) that occur from one speaking turn to the next—in meetings of 10 groups of managers. The results point to a range of relational obligations and entitlements, such as the obligation subordinates have to bolster superiors’ control of the floor, and the way in which friendship and co‐working ties get expressed through remarks made to third parties. The article is perhaps the first to link statistically network‐analytic and conversation‐analytic levels of analysis."

The psychoanalytic standpoint is intesive rather than extensive, scientific and therapeutic rather than indoctrinating. It is an interview rather than a participant, spectator, or collector relationship; and it is an insight interview. The criteria of insight are formulated, and the point is made that simultaneous insight into the person, personality, and culture is obtained. From this standpoint the insight interview is a means of acquiring skill in the discovery of culture and hence important for social scientists who are mainly concerned with culture. The psychoanalytic standpoint has prompted the use of more intensive methods in social observation; psychoanalytic hypotheses and findings have stimulated research. The rich yield of intensive investigation has called for more refined definitions of basic terms like ""trait,"" ""reaction,"" ""person,"" ""personality,"" ""conduct,"" ""behavior,"" and ""culture"" and has posed the task of calibrating the observations made from one standpoint with observations made in any other position along the continuum of intensiveness-extensiveness."

This variation is explained by a model of path‐dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work."

Conflict makes for a total functionalizing of thought which is interpreted only in terms of its alleged social, economic, political, or psychological sources and functions. Deepened social conflict today renews the relevance of an old problem in the sociology of knowledge: socially patterned differentials in access to new knowledge. As groups and collectivities become more self-conscious and solidary under conditions of social polarization, their members tend to claim unique or privileged access to certain kinds of knowledge. This can be described as the doctrine of the Insider, which includes the correlative claim that the Outsider has a structurally imposed incapacity for access to such knowledge. Outsider doctrine involves complementary claims of access to knowledge grounded on the assumption of socially based detachment. The rationale of the Insider doctrine is examined, with special references to the advocates of a ""black social science,"" a case taken as prototypical for other Insider doctrines based on sex, age, religion, nationality, etc. Structural analysis in terms of status sets indicates that Insider and Outsider doctrines based on affiliation with a single collectivity or occupancy of a single status are necessarily unstable and inadequate. The paper concludes by examining the distinctive interactive roles of Insiders and Outsiders that involve interchange, tradeoffs, and syntheses in the formation of social knowledge."

You know the truth–how can anyone dream that mere simplicity and goodness will get him friends, or even acquaintancs not actually harmful and annoying?…. The world is amply supplied with fraudulent, false, perfidious, bold, audacious, and rapacious men. Everything in the world is profoundly unsure…. The deal with human wickedness in all its boldness, daring, and greed one must beable to remain constant, temperate, and full of inner strength. These are the qualities I would like to see actually practiced by a man whose friendship I hoped to gain and enjoy….

The socially shared presuppositions they brought to their reading caused West Indian reviewers to interpret Lamming's novels as involving questions of personal and national identity, British reviewers to concentrate on the novels' language and literary qualities, and American reviewers to emphasize race. Each of Lamming's novels exercises a different degree of ""cultural power,"" and this capacity to engender multiple meanings while retaining coherence shows that cultural meanings emerge from the interaction between cultural works of varying power and human recipients of varying expectations and concerns. In turn, this interaction suggests a theory of metaphor that enables research in the sociology of culture to utilize both cultural and sociological data without reducing one to the other."

The author develops theoretical arguments to explicate the mechanisms that generate the intersubjective evaluation of the “social standings” of occupations and that give deference to occupations that can make legitimate claims on the bases of nature and reason. The proposed theoretical ideas are tested by examining patterns of occupational prestige ranking reported in 1989 GSS data.

Moreover, these benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the friendship‐network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved if a manager’s competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors."

In achieving this definition he passes through three stages: (1) the stage of insecurity of role, (2) the stage of gradual definition of role, and (3) the stage of validation of role. In the course of this development the student usually believes that he is achieving his ends by learning from his informants. In point of fact, however, he is teaching them to assume the role behavior which will enable him to learn from them."

This article develops a theory of self-labeling processes to account for the unexplained phenomenon of voluntary treatment seeking. By taking the role of the generalized other, individual can assess the meaning of their impulses and actions. When individuals observe themselves frequently or persistently breaking ""residual rules,"" they attribute disturbance to themselves and may seek professional help. Drawing from Hochschild and Pugliesi, the article reconceptualized "" residual rule-breaking"" as violations of feeling or expression norms. When individuals are unable to manage or transform deviant feelings, self-attributions of disturbance should result. The conditions under which feeling management attempts are likely to fail and result in self-attributions of disturbance are outlined in the context of a more general theory of emotional processes. Some conditions under which labeling by others may occur are also identified, using the same theoretical approach."

Both assumptions are here questioned. Operational definitions, in common with any other method of increasing the precision of the meaning of a concept, undoubtedly frequently limit that meaning and so exclude some meanings which were previously attached to the term. It does not follow that the meanings so excluded are denied or debarred from study. These neglected aspects are themselves subject to precise and operational definition. Various other misunderstandings of the operational and positivistic position are discussed. The hypothesis is advanced that in sociology, as in other natural sciences, some of the opposition to the positivistic approach may be due to its apparent lack in aesthetic and literary qualities to minds conditioned by the scientific philosophy of the nineteenth century. A series of specific questions is propounded in the hope of clarifying the issues under consideration."

Socialization effects of family roles on marijuana use are reflected in the reduced risk of marijuana initiation after marriage among women and the increased rate of stopping marijuana use after marriage among women and after parenthood among men.

To address this conundrum, this article utilizes sibling data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and extends structural equation sibling models to incorporate siblings' genetic relationships in order to explore the role of families' social characteristics for adolescent weight. The article is the first to demonstrate that the association between parents' obesity and adolescent weight is both social and genetic. Furthermore, by incorporating genetic information, the shared and social origins of the correlation between inactivity and weight are better revealed."

Above all, Nisbet's charge that the new evolutionism is based on metaphor and analogy ignores entirely the increasingly substantial empirical grounding to theory in archaeological, historical, and socilogical research. Also, his effort to force scholars to choose between the nomothetic concerns of evolutionists and the idiographic concerns of historians and some historical sociologist invites conflict where cooperation is needed."

This essay explores his views about the depletion of social resources stressed in modern theory. It elaborates his ""antisociology"" and then traces the impact of this framework on three divergent currents of social theory. Nietzsche is read against the backdrop of modern theory in order to explore his continuing challenge to this tradition and his relevance to sociology."

The claim to face may rest on the basis of status, whether ascribed or achieved, and on personal or nonpersonal factors; it may also vary according to the group with which a person is interacting. Basic differences are found between the processes involved in gaining versus losing face. While it is not a necessity for one to strive to gain face, losing face is a serious matter which will, in varying degrees, affect one's ability to function effectively in society. Face is lost when the individual, either through his action or that of people closely related to him, fails to meet essential requirements placed upon him by virtue of the social position he occupies. In contrast to the ideology of individualism, the question of face frequently arises beyond the realm of individual responsibility and subjective volition. Reciprocity is inherent in face behavior, wherein a mutually restrictive, even coercive, power is exerted upon each member of the social network. It is argued that face behavior is universal and that face should be utilized as a construct of central importance in the social sciences."

Until now American sociology has covered only the necessary rudimentary period of determining working categories. The place of Lester F. Ward in the movement is indicated.

To study another relationship, that between organizational environments and performance levels, four long-lived newspapers were investigated separately. The findings show that institutional environmental variables, especially political turmoil, strongly affect the rates of founding and failure but only weakly affect performance. In contrast, task environmental variables are more closely associated with the performances of individual organizations and less with the organizational demographics of the industry."

At the same time, their presentist orientation toward sociology's past has prevented a direct examination of the utilitarians in their own right. This paper rejects that orientation and investigates the social theory of the major utilitarians. David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. No alleged characteristic of utilitarianism-from the atomistic, rationalistic model of social action to the failure to solve the problem of order-adduced in the traditional attack upon it is actually found in the work of the utilitarians. The paper then outlines the historical process whereby the prevailing mythology concerning utilitarianism developed. The hallmark of that process is not the cumulative development of social theories but the displacement, in changing cultural and social circumstances, of the concerns of utilitarian social theory-a displacement succesively evident in the work of Spencer, early American social scintists, and Park and climaxing in Parson's The Structure of Social Action. The paper concludes by offering a sociological interpretation of Parson's selective account of utilitarian social theory and by identifying the constricting, but still pervasive, theoretical implications of that account."

Legal cynicism refers to a cultural frame in which people perceive the law as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety.

Using 123 in‐depth interviews with later‐generation Mexican Americans, this article shows that Mexican immigrant replenishment shapes ethnic boundaries and ethnic identity formation. The sizable immigrant population sharpens intergroup boundaries through the indirect effects of nativism and by contributing to the continuing significance of race in the lives of later‐generation Mexican Americans. The presence of a large immigrant population also creates intragroup boundaries that run through the Mexican‐origin population and that are animated by expectations about ethnic authenticity.

Variation in perceived meanings along dimensions of definition, morality, or threat helps explain the speed of group inclusion, the amount of mobilization needed, and possiblity for failure. Ethnoracial minorities benefited from perceptions of definitional and moral similarity to blacks, but elites perceived women as different definitionally and white ethnics as different definitionally and morally.

Consequently, these interpreters have critized positions that are attributed to Mead but which he did not propose. The social behaviorist interpretation of the ""I"" is more consistent with the textual evidence. By extending and slightly reformulating Mead's theory, the latter part of the paper aims to show that the social behaviorist interpretation is also more theoretically fertile and methodologically applicable."

The fields of art and science were considered essentially antithetical in methodology as well as in practice. Art was the product of the intuition of the privileged man, and science of the disciplined reason which almost anyone could exercise. Although the ""great man theory"" of art still lingers, there is evidence of an interest in the social analysis of aesthetic culture. Aesthetic culture has been variously conceived as a ""social luxury,"" as a reflection of its age, as an autonomous experience, as an escape from personal disorganization. From the critique of these theories it is apparent that beauty is a folkway that is buttressed by rationalizations that are linked to certain circumstances. It is almost more plausible to state that the theory of art is socially conditioned that that art itself is so determined."

Since lottery tickets are assets with negative expected return, lottery play challenges the basic assumptions of economic theory. This article approaches lottery play from a networks perspective and focuses on syndicate play. A comparison of the development of lottery markets in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Portugal from the 17th century onward shows that lottery play declined with rising incomes except in countries in which syndicate play diffused widely, namely, Spain, and to a lesser extent, Portugal. Although syndicating originated among the relatively poor as a response to an increase in lottery prices, it persisted even when individual play became affordable. This article contends that syndicating endured because of an institutionalization process by which lottery tickets have transformed from purely economic assets into symbolic carriers of interpersonal ties that convey membership and status position in relevant social networks."

Simon's unmeasurable averages are operationalized as the marginals in the 2 X 2 table and can be found directly from two coupled equations in the marginals, if the rate parameters satisfy certain constraints. An additional independent equation reflects a correlation of attributes across individuals not considered by Simon. Several ways to estimate parameters and test the model are discussed."

The study reported here, based on a vignette experiment (with a design that varies patient status with the nature of behavior), challenges this conclusion. Like previous research, it indicates that a simple assessment of labelings shows little effect on a social distance scale. However, when a measure of perceived dangerousness of mental patients is introduced, strong labeling effects emerge. Specifically, the data reveal that the lable of ""previous hospitalization"" fosters high social distance among those who perceive mental patients to be dangerous and low social distance among those who do not see patients as a threat. It appears that past investigators have missed these effects because they have averaged excessively lenient responses with excessively rejecting ones. This suggests that labels play an important role in how former mental patients are perceived and that labeling theory should not be dismissed as a framework for understanding social factors in mental illness."

Analyses of data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) show that about a quarter of men experience partner betweennessa and that these men are 92% more likely to report erectile dysfunction. Partner betweenness is strongest among the youngest men in the sample, which may reflect changing conceptions of masculinity in later life. The authors consider several explanations for these findings and urge additional research on the links between health, gender, and network structure."

Schmitt AND Richard Herman,American Journal of Sociology,79,3,1973-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 566-588,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"This research parallels a previous investigation of the authors of pre-industrial American family pattern during the 1741-91 period. The present investigation involves a content analysis of colonial magazines for 1794-1825. Special attention is given to power patterns, types of attitudes between the sexes, actions toward premarital and extramarital sex involvement, and motivations for entering the marital relationship. The results concerning overt power among male and females that could be subjected to statistical examination in both studies exhibited an almost identical pattern. There was evidence of general existent and advocated overt male power, although such male power was mediated by other forms of female power as follows: there was evidence of existent overt female power and subtle female power in both courtship and the home. There was also evidence of advocated mutual cooperation between the sexes and extended role activities of the female. This latter trend in the direction of status and power of the women in the 1974-1825 period shows a general change over the period of the earlier study. The evidence regarding romantic love in the fictional material occurred to a greater extent than in our first study. The nonfictional discussions of romatic love and motivations were noticeably less frequent in this study than in the prior study. There were very few director or direct discussions of sexual standards. This contrasts with the results of our previous study. It is suggested that the family during the period 1794-1825 was influenced by ongoing internal structural changes, the consequences of the conditions of settlement in America, and humanistic and ideological beliefs which had their roots both in Europe and America. These influences are explored along with their implications for the analysis of changing family structures in historic perspective."

Current approaches to this problem draw on Émile Durkheim and emphasize the way commemorative objects celebrate society's former glories. This article on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial deals with the way society assimilates past events that are less than glorious and whose memory induces controversy instead of consensus. The Vietnam War differed from other wars because it was politically controversial and morally questionable and resulted in defeat; it resembled other wars because it called out in participants the traditional virtues of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. The task of representing these contrasting aspects of the war in a single monument was framed by the tension between contrasting memorial genres. Focusing on the discursive field out of which the Vietnam Veterans Memorial emerged, this analysis shows how opposing social constituencies articulated the ambivalence attending memories of the Vietnam War. Ambivalence was expressed not only in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial's design but also in the design of Vietnam War monuments later erected throughout the United States. These efforts to memorialize a divisive war, along with attempts in other nations to come to terms with the difficulties of their past, call into question Durkheim's belief that moral unity is the ultimate object of commemoration. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and devices like it come into view not as symbols of solidarity but as structures that render more explicit, and more comprehensible, a nation's conflicting conceptions of itself and its past."

Analyzing tertiary streets can better predict racial composition than can spatial considerations. Segregated networks of neighborly relations emerge from segregated networks of residential streets. Racial populations are organized in space with respect to who is “down the street” rather than in terms of mere physical distance."

Using the example of media rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological concept of reactivity—the idea that people change their behavior in reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured—offers a useful lens for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically."

The limitations and bias of both are discussed below. More recent field work throws new light on the ancient controversies and suggests that a revision is in order both in terminology and in thinking if objectivity and realism are to be preserved. The data suggest that woman's social status and the sexual role accorded her in society are related facts which find expression in the rules and attitudes governing marital and extra-marital relations."

Within a few moments, the highly integrated collectivity that has dominated its individual members (prejump phase) changes drastically into a tenuous, anomic social situation that gives rise to a very egocentric individuality followed by a return to the former state (postjump phase). This bipolarity of parachuting provides a rare opportunity to study a nearly ideal-typical manifestation of extreme opposite social forms contained within a organizational setting. The sequence of the three phases of the jump, and the dialectical relationship among them, is analyzed here in terms of personal regression leading to social regression, and vice versa. The ambivalence of these relatioships becomes evident in the functional analysis of parachuting's radical implications for individuals as well as for the group and the larger (military) organization."

However, emergence has also been invoked by methodological individualists; they accept the existence of emergent social properties yet claim that such properties can be reduced to explanations in terms of individuals and their relationships. Thus, contemporary sociological uses of emergence are contradictory and unstable. This article clarifies this situation by developing an account of emergence based in contemporary philosophy of mind. The philosophical account is used to evaluate contradictory sociological theories. Several unresolved issues facing theories of emergence in sociology are identified."

Closer and more fruitful relationships between theories of industrialized behavior and theories of collective behavior depend in part on the development of a social-level onception of collective behavior. To this end the two forms of social organization are contrated along the dimensions of social norms and social relationships. On these dimensions, a definition and a typology of collective behavior are suggested."

But investigation shows that the social group, whether represented by the family, the institution, or by other social clusters, is, like the individual, equally resistant to all approach and for the same reason, namely, that personal systematization and self-envelopment have automatically rendered them inaccessible to any view that is not in accord with the private view maintained by them. It is important, therefore, to secure conditions favorable to an analysis of our institutional prejudices if we are not to give warrant to these spurious formations within the tissue of our social organism. This situation may be experimentally demostrated through the analysis of social groups, and leads inevitably to an altered basis of psychiatric approach."

A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach."

Information is found to be more diffused in highly cohesive departments (characterized by the presence of many groups), especially among non-integrated students, thus indicating the importance of the relative density of group interaction in the flow of information.

Such societal concepts as folkways, mores, and fashions are vague and obscure and leas to confusion and inaccuracy. Specific questions essential to clear understanding of conformity are whether uniformity and conformity exist in the behavior of individuals under observation, in what respect people conform, to what degree, what proportion of the individuals conform, the nature of ""conformity-producing agents,"" etc. The J-curve hypothesis of conformity rests upon the following conceptual basis. Instead of regarding conformity in the dichotomous ""all-or-none"" manner, the approach here suggested is one more consistent with general scientific procedure, namely, to measure degrees of conformity on a continuum. In this context continua are classified under two types, empirical and nonempirical, and the latter is subdivided into a personality continuum and a telic continuum (measuring purpose fulfilment). A ""field of conformity"" is defined when there is a generally accepted, though not necessarily explicitly stated, rule and purpose in the situation, and when 50 per cent or more of the population fall upon the first step of a telic (conformity) continuum whose variable is degrees of fulfilment of this rule and purpose. The two major formulations of the J-curve hypothesis are: (1) the distribution of degrees of conformity upon their appropriate continuum is in the form of a curve of positive acceleration toward the mode and (2) in any conformity field the distribution of measurable variations of the behavior upon a relevant empirical, or nontelic, continuum is in the form of a steep unimodal,double J-curve, in which the mode is likely to be off center and the slopes are likely to be asymmetrical."

Results from a maximum-likelihood probit model that uses data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey indicate that couples' orientation to the ""provider role"" shapes how they respond to job opportunities. A husband's potential loss from a move appears to deter wives from capitalizing on opportunities at a new location, but a wife's potential loss does not deter husbands. However, differences by gender are substantially smaller among men and women who reject traditional notions about husbands'and wives' roles within families.

Finally, the manner in which role-taking emotions (feelings that presuppose role taking) facilitate social control is treated, using symbolic interactionist tenets.

Using two decades of longitudinal data from a national survey, they demonstrate that not only does an individual’s race change over time, it changes in response to myriad changes in social position, and the patterns are similar for both self-identification and classification by others. These findings suggest that, in the contemporary United States, microlevel racial fluidity serves to reinforce existing disparities by redefining successful or high-status people as white (or not black) and unsuccessful or low-status people as black (or not white). Thus, racial differences are both an input and an output in stratification processes; this relationship has implications for theorizing and measuring race in research, as well as for crafting policies that attempt to address racialized inequality."

While these changes occur, the long-standing assumption that the absence of Catholics in scholarly careers is a proof of Catholic intellectual inferiority remains essentially unchallenged."

Such control was achieved in the study here reported by measurement of the groups to be compared when they were living in the same rural communities before migration had ocurred. A sample of 2, 544 high-school studentss was given a standard intelligence test in 1922-23. In 1935 residential data were obtained and the former students were classified as rural and urban. The urban group was in turn divided into four classes according to city size. The urban migrants were found to be superior as measured by the test scores, and their superiority was greatest in cities of metropolitan class. Out-of-state migrants excelled the group remaining in Kansas. The results indicate that the urban environment is exerting a stronger pull upon the abler rural inhabitants of the state, though this selection does not necesarily have any genetic significance."

Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003–7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do “women’s work” in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes.

The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of ""truth claims"" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies."

A model is presented here to remedy that problem; it reintroduces the variable of size but in a manner distinct from Writh's. Population concentration produces a diversityof subcultures, strengthens them, and fosters diffusion among them. Together, these three mediating variables account for urban unconventionality. The four propositions of the theory and three others deducible from it are examined against existing research."

Origin of the idea of progress. It arose in Greek thought from the changes and processes in nature and life. But the notion of regress was opposed to it These conflicting views result from the different types of minds. 2. Brief historical survey. The views of progress and regress are traced in Greek and Roman thought, throught early Christianity and the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the eighteenth century. The theory of evolution in the nineteenth century made progress a necessary law of nature and gave the doctrine its first conscious scientific form. But criticism shows that it fails like its predecessors. 3. Possibilities and limitations of progress. Only in Psychical nature of man has there been real progress. Intellectual, aesthetic, and ethical progress have been unquestionable. Every science and art have been advanced. 4. The actual progress of human intelligence. This is seen in the improved art of living mechanical inventions, and division of labor. But industrial evolution has brought with it new dangers. Material progress does not necessarily better man's own nature. 5. True progress concerns man himself. Aesthetic betterment is desirable and possible. But the ethical problem is the supreme difficulty. Morality rests in freedom and can be brought under control only by the individual himself. Intelligence simply, magnifies the power for good or evil. Man is both better and worse than ever before. The rationalizing of life is the only road to true progress. 6. Social progress. Forms of government are merely conditions of social opportunity. The Versailles Treaty was a step backward. The United States is drifting on uncharted seas. But civilization is in no danger of relapse. The printing-press has built a storehouse for knowledge that precludes a recrudescence of the Dark Ages. Man has advanced along the lines of his desires and finds happiness in their realization. The whole history of science and philosophy is on the record of a ceaseless progress."

The logical unites the action with the end in view, both subjectively and objectively. All other actions are non-logical. Non-logical actions may have no logical end, only a subjectively logical end, only an objectively logical end, or a subjectively and objectively logical end, though the end does not correspond with the purpose. In human societies non-logical actions are more numerous and more important, but students of social phenomena have disregarded them because of the preconceptions in their own minds. Pareto makes a distinction between truth as experimental science conceives it, and social utility. Another distinction is that between residues, a constant, instinctive part of social phenomena, and derivations, a deductive part that aims to explain, justify, and demonstrate the first. The main classes of the residues are: combination-residues, which compel men to innovate; persistence of aggregates, residues which compel men to conserve; those which compel men to express their sentiments by means of outward acts; those which make a man a social being; the residues of the integrity of the individual; and sexual residues. In one's effort to give logical derivations and demonstrate the universality of his theory he arrives at derivatives. Derivations may appeal to authority, tradition, custom; to sentiments, principles, collective interest,juridical, metaphysical, or supernatural entities; or may be verbal proofs, using metaphorical, dubious, or indefinite terms. There is little or no change in the intensity of a whole class of residues, though there is some in the genera of each class; residues are not equally distributed nor equally strong in the various strata of society. Residues may act upon other residues, and upon derivations; derivations may act upon residues and upon other derivations. In addition to these three elements of social phenomena there are interests, social heterogeneity, and the circulation of classes. The most prosperous society is the one in which the first two residues especially are found in a certain proportion, though this proportion cannot be given in figures."

Using over‐time analysis of the adoption of these programs in 389 U.S. organizations, historical research, and interviews with human resources managers, this study demonstrates that organizations added dependent care expense accounts in response to changes in tax law and, in particular, to the creative interpretation by benefits consultants of a seemingly concrete and clear law. Although the tax break included in the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act was intended to spur employers to create child care centers, these programs are still rare.

Emotional factors strongly effect the ""fruitfulness"" and ""direction"" of the intelligence; but we still insist upon treating intelligence as a thing apart. Evidence is offered that intelligence is part of a total organic attitude involving also attitudes of mind, emotional conditions, ingrained habits, and conditioned behavior. In children of high-school age this total attitude is the essential factor in counseling and segregation. The greater the emotional contribution to the total attitude, the more subordinate is the intelligence. This attitude is a changing complex in response to situational factors. Transient situations may produce emotional disturbances reflected in lower results in mental testing at such times. The inequalities in mental tests from a given child are an index to his emotional capacity. The total organic attitude becomes more complex through the operation of a long-continued disturbing situation, possibly also through inherent characteristics of the individual reacting in extraordinary ways to temporary situations. Inasmuch as behavior grows out of this total attitude and decisions in domestic, educational, and vocational crises are dictated by it, the total attitude itself and the situational factors which produced it are the essential factors in counseling high-school children. Classes segregated according to these factors present more uniform teaching problems than classes segregated on the basis of intelligence tests alone."

Those who join the party while young enter a career path that includes sponsorship for adult education and more likely promotion. While the party's preference for youth from “red” classes has yielded to one for prior education, party sponsorship endures. Because patronage blurs distinctions between politics and merit, it confounds interpretations of returns to individual attributes."

All roles contain elements which are more or less institutionalized, though in any specific roles relationship there may be disagreement, concerning appropriate norms, among ego, alter, and the social networks of ""third parties"" involved. Thus, pressure toward fulfilment of role obligations is analyzed in terms of (1) ego's socialized emotional commitment to his appropiate role behavior; (2) alter's requirement that ego performs appropriately; and (3) the rewards and punishments of ""third parties.""

Socio-economic differences are reflected in school honesty, but only slightly in service tendencies, and these slight differences are swallowed up in community differences, as shown, e.g., by the superiority of a mid-social group in helpfulness and co-operation. The classroom group, although far from being a ""natural"" group, shows evidences of possessing a distinctive morale, or code, which operates as one factor in determining scores on tests of conduct and knowledge. It would seem that the pupils respond to the classroom (its prestige, expectancy, morale, code, teacher, or what not) as a factor common to all test situations. The result is a group correlation between knowledge and conduct which has no necessary counterpart in the individual integration of the members of the group. The more the members of groups resemble their own group-mates, the less differentiated they appear. The more groups as groups resemble one another the better differentiated the members may become. On the whole the integration of children in Grades 5 to 8 is only slightly more than chance would provide."

In turn, the characteristics of actual supporters (in this case boards of directors) should be related to organizational effectiveness. Aggregate measures of the socioeconomic composition of boards of directors of thirty-four branches of the YMCA of Chicago are found to be correlated with demographic measures on the areas each serves. Furthermore, the composition of the boards is correlated with measures of organizational and board effectiveness. The demographic measures are also correlated with the spatial work-residence patterns of board members. The over-all import of the study is to link ecological and organizational analysis."

Persons interested in becoming integrated members of a group are under pressure to impress the other members that they would make attractive associates, but the resulting competition for popularity gives rise to defensive tactics that block social integration. A member who can provide valued services to the others forces them to give up their defensive tendencies and manifest their attraction to him; the process in which his services are exchanged for their respect and defense gives rise to social differentiation. Alternatively, one who demonstrates his approachibility obviates the need for the difensiveness of other and thus frees them to express their feeling of attraction to him; the process in which his disclaimer of superordinate status is exchanged for their acceptance gives rise to social integration. Empirical data support the hypothesis that acceptance as a peer depends on approachability as well as attractiveness."

The decline of the private house ensembles (Hauskapellen) resulted in a social broadening of music patronage and thereby tended to erode the traditional institutional means for aristocratic authority in musical affairs. The exclusive function that the qualitatively different ideology of ""serious"" music could provide reaffirmed traditional cultural boundaries through ideological rather than institutional means and enabled Vienna's old aristocrats to emerge after 1800 as the city's ""most brilliant"" dilettantes."

This viewpoint is brought to bear on some of the theory and data of Henry and Short's Suicide and Homicide. After presentation of a theory relating sociological variables to the socialization of aggression, hypotheses are derived similar to those of Henry and Short. These hypotheses are tested, employing an index of preference for suicide or homicide, the Suicide-Murder Ratio (SMR). Consideration of the socialization process as it is related to the American class structure resolves some issues raised by Henry and Short's theory of external restraint and effectively predicts the findings. The results are considered in terms of Durkheim's belief that the choice of suicide or homicide resulting from anomie is purely a psychological problem and from the standpoint of Henry and Short's assertion that the choice is in part determined by sociological variables."

It is probably more important that Negroes who attend integrated schools will have more contact with whites as adults, and tend to have more trust in whites than do Negroes from segregated schools. This in turn partially overcomes a crucial barrier to equal opportunity-the fact that information about employment opportunities is spread through types of informal social contacts to which few Negroes have access."

While delinquency is related to all four variables, multivariate analysis suggests that two of the variables, delinquent associations and perceived opportunity, are more likely to be consequences of delinquency than causes of it. Achievement motivation, which apparently precedes delinquency and is positively related to it, is so related only for lower-and working-class boys. The author argues that this relationship probably results from the sensibity of law enforcement agents to high achievement motivation related behavior rather than from any inclination of highly motivated lower-class youhts to commit excessive amounts of crime."

This report deals with the extent and ways in which racial, urban, and certain other attitudes are influenced by city of residence. The initial evidence is formal in character and simply shows that city of residence accounts for significant proportions of variance in a wide range of attitudes-proportions not greatly different from those accounted for by five individual background variables (age, sex, education, income, and occupation) and largely independent of these background variables. Attitudes best explained by city seem to be those with some urban content, and specially those that involve individual perceptions of the immediate urban environment. The outcomes are similar for black and white respondents, and for some specific attitudes there is surprising similarity in the ranking of cities across race. Questions are raised about the relation of attitudes to urban riots: Detroit, which had a major riot, is moderate relative to other cities in attitudes presumed to be relevant to open racial conflict. Particularly promising is the finding that black dissatisfaction with life conditions in their city goes down as black percentage of the population goes up-possibly because the city government becomes more responsive to black needs. Liberal racial attitudes on the part of the white population are closely associated with variations in white educational levels by city. While part of this relatioship is simply a reflection of individual level correlations, part appears to be due to the indirect effects of education on the general climate of opinion in a city. City of residence would seem to be a useful explanatory variable in studies of attitudes."

The person as the Individual with Status: The study of individual behavior falls in the fields of psychiatry and psychology. The study of the person, as the product of social interaction, lies, primarily, in sociology. In the explanation and control of delinquency, it is significant to determine the nature of the participation of the person in the social organization, as in the insecurity or degradation of status, the type of personal behavior pettern, the degree of mobility, the change of the social environment and the collapse of the social world of the person. In the study of delinquency, the psychiatric, psychological, and sociological methods of investigation are not in conflict with each other, but rather complementary and interdependent."

The present interest is in the effort to understand the person. One group of students approaches the problems from an essentially neurological point of view and set of assumptions. The other group conceives social nature to be developed through interaction from an active but relatively amorphous and plastic original nature. The basic differences between the two groups of students seem to be inherent and irreconcilable, but the fundamental character of the disagreement is not always recognized."

Most previous estimates of interpersonal influences are based on the adolescent's perceptions of the significant other's attitudes or behaviors rather than on the significant other's self-reports of these attributes. Estimates of interpersonal influences based upon self-reported attributes are presented. It is shown that perceptual measures inflate estimates of interpersonal influence. Independent data from parents document that perceptual measures of significant others' attributes reflect not only attributes of the person being perceived but also attributes of the perceiver. Parental influence on the adolescent's aspirations is stronger than peer influence, and this influence does not decline over the adolescent years. Peers are involved in a process of reciprocal influence, and peer influences are stronger among girls than among boys."

The motives bringing peoples of divergent races and cultures together are, in the first instance, economic. In the long run, economic intercouse enforces more intimate personal and cultural relations, and eventually amalgamation takes place. When the peoples involved are widely different in culture and in racial characteristics, and particularly when they are distinguished by physical marks, assimilation and amalgamation take place very slowly. When the resulting hybrid peoples exhibit physical traits that mark them off and distinguish them from both parent-stocks, the mixed bloods are likely to constitute a distinct caste or class occupying a position and status midway between the two races of which they are composed. The mixed bloods tend everywhere to be, as compared with the full bloods with whom they are identified, an intellectual and professional class. The most obvious and generally accepted explanation of the superiority of the mixed bloods is that the former are the products of two races, one of which is biologically inferior and the other biologically superior. In the case of the Negro-white hybrids in the United States, other and less obvious explanations have been offered. It has been pointed out, for example, that the mulatto is the result of a social selection which began during the period os slavery, when the dominant whites selected for their concubines the most comely, and presumably the superior, women among the Negroes. There is, however, the fact to be considered that in a society where racial distinctions are rigidly maintained, the mixed blood tends to be keenly conscious of his position. He feels, as he frequently says, the conflict of warring ancestry in his veins. The conflict of color is embodied, so to speak, in his person. His minds is the melting pot in which the lower and the higher cultures meet and fuse."

Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.

This paper discusses the guardians of impersonal trust and discovers that, in the quest for agent fidelity, they create new problems. The resulting collection of procedural norms, structural constraints, entry restrictions, policing mechanisms, social-control specialists, and insurance-like arrangements increases the opportunities for abuse while it encourages less acceptable trustee performance. Moreover, this system sometimes leads people to throw good ""money"" after bad; they protect trust and respond to its failures by conferring even more trust. The paper explores the sources and consequences of the paradox that the guardians of trust are themselves trustees."

First, black‐white inequality has obscured the actual status homogamy typifying intermarriage. Second, gender differences among young couples have been mistaken for racially specific patterns of exchange. Third, the empirical findings that appear to support status‐caste exchange are not robust. The author’s conclusions favor the simplest tabular analyses, which cast doubt on status‐caste exchange theory."

Erlanger,American Journal of Sociology,105,2,1999-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 406-54,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Most accounts of organizations and law treat law as largely exogenous and emphasize organizations' responses to law. This study proposes a model of endogeneity among organizations, the professions, and legal institutions. It suggests that organizations and the professions strive to construct rational responses to law, enabled by ""rational myths"" or stories about appropriate solutions that are themselves modeled after the public legal order. Courts, in turn, recognize and legitimate organizational structures that mimic the legal form, thus conferring legal and market benefits upon organizational structures that began as gestures of compliance. Thus, market rationality can follow from rationalized myths: the professions promote a particular compliance strategy, organizations adopt this strategy to reduce costs and symbolize compliance, and courts adjust judicial constructions of fairness to include these emerging organizational practices. To illustrate this model, a case study of equal employment opportunity (EEO) grievance procedures is presented in this article."

Two major parental characteristics-education and race-modify these general patterns. In turn, taste differences in subpopulations reveal their general esthetics dispositions. The authors present these results as the first large-scale systematic comparison of educational differences in naming patterns in the United States."

This article makes such an attempt with all Western European countries experiencing democratic rule between 1870 and 1939. It seeks (1) to explain what structural and historical features distinguish the breakdown cases from those that remained democratic, and (2) to trace the process of class coalition formation in the transition to democracy and the subsequent breakdown. Moore's thesis does fit, with some modification. All four breakdwn cases were characterized historically by an authoritarian coalition of labor-repressive landlords, the state, and the bourgeoisie that contributed to the breakdown of democratic rule in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast, in none of the democratic survivors did such a coalition materialize. This difference can be traced largely to the strenght of the agrarian elite in the late 19th century. However, in contrast to Moore's characterization of the conservative authoritarian path, the ruling coalition, except in Germany, did not play a modernizing role, and only in Austria can the bourgeoisie be described as a ""dependent"" partner in the coalition. Moreover, because it stops too early, Moore's analysis greatly underplays the role of the organized working class in the transition to democracy and attributes far too positive a role to the bourgeoisie."

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and effects of workers’ responses to the changes they confront in their work situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing a fourfold typology of workers’ responses, the author shows how each type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the restructuring of their jobs."

Generalized exchange systems emerge from inequalities exogenous to the kinship system, specifically gerontocracy. Models of norms are weak predictors of actual exchange structures.

Both university scholars and humanists were rationally trained. Their methods, however, were determined by their professional conditions and differed substantially from the methods of science. Both professors and humanistic literati distinguished liberal from mechanical arts and despised manual labor, experimentation, and dissection. Craftsmen were the pioneers of causal thinking in this period. Certain groups of superior manual labores (artistengineers, surgeons, the makers of nautical and musical instruments, surveyors, navigators, gunners) experimented, dissected, and used quantitative methods. The measuring instruments of the navigators, surveyors, and gunners were the forerunners of the later physical instruments. The craftsmen, however, lacked methodical intellectual training. Thus the two components of the scientific method were separated by a social barrier: logical training was reserved for upper-class scholars; experimentation, causal interest, and quantitative method were left to more or less plebeian artisans. Science was born when, with the progress of technology, the experimental method eventually overcame the social prejudice against manual labor and was adopted by rationally trained scholars. This was accomplished about 1600 (Gilbert, Galileo, Bacon). At the same time the scholastic method of disputation and the humanistic ideal of individual glory were superseded by the ideals of control of nature and advancement of learning through scientific co-operation. In a somewhat different way, sociologically, modern astronomy developed. The whole process was imbedded in the advance of early capitalistic society, which weakened collective-mindedness, magical thinking, and belief in authority and which furthered worldly, causal, rational, and quantitative thinking."

The argument is that continued economic development in our society has led to increases in the demand for female labor which, combined with demographically induced shifts in the supply of unmarried and young women, have resulted in the considerable post-World War II rise in the labor-force participation of married women. The evidence is that these changes are irreversible and will not be greatly affected by the entry of the baby-boom cohorts into the labor market. Nevertheless, women's increasing dissatisfaction with job opportunities can be expected because several of the higher-level traditional female occupations will probably not expand greatly in the near future."

In contrast with the more commonly used textbookish political knowledge indices, this measure corresponds more closely to knowledge-in-use. Conceptual integration is defined as the spontaneous and explicit organization of ideas and information in terms of abstract or ideological constructs and represents an expansion of Philip Converse's research on levels of ideological thinking in mass publics. These two related dimensions of political information processing emerge from a detailed content analysis of depth interview transcripts. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the way citizens relate the condition of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and to political authorities. As expected, education plays a central role in explaning these patterns, but there are some surprising interactive linkages between education and patterns of political thought. One specially intriguing finding is that conservatives have significantly lower scores than liberals on indices of differentiation and integration. The ramifications of these findings for survey research methodology and theories of mass political behavior are discussed."

Turnover associated with organizational change appears to be concentrated among the most senior employees, suggesting “old guard disenchantment” as the primary cause. The results are consistent with the claim of neoinstitutionalist scholars that founders impose cultural blueprints on nascent organizations and with the claim of organizational ecologists that altering such blueprints is disruptive and destabilizing."

The cultural patterns represented were in constant conflict with one another-a conflict which is examined in its effects upon the standards of each group in respect to housing, sexual relationships, and participation in group activities. Two hypotheses are suggested in conclusion: (1) the conflict of cultures in a community results in some integration but also in the emergence of common conflict patterns and (2) such common conflict patterns need not represent a transitional stage of development to a common culture but may in themselves form a part of a stabilized form of culture."

If a given set of cases were identical in their component elements, a complete, accurate description of one would give as much as would statistical generalizations concerning the total number. In a number of cases, major aspects, likenesses, and differences might be distilled from a mass of irrelevant detail and the conclusions reduced to a statistical basis. But a careful scrutiny of records would be necessary to reveal qualitative as well as quantitative differences and make prediction valid."

In the establishment of family life, the adjustment of cultural differences took three main forms: the Hawaiian, the Chinese, and the biracial-the most characteristics type of family organization, involving a fusion and adaptation of Oriental and Polynesian elements. With large immigrations of other racial and cultural groups, the Chinese rose in economic and political position, while the Hawaiian culture became increasingly disintegrated and the Hawaiian group more and more disorganized. Intermarriage between pure Chinese and pure Hawaiians became relatively infrequent. A modification of the bi-racial pattern has also come about throught the Americanization of Hawaii.

In plant and animal societies competition is unrestricted by an institutional or moral order. Human society is a consequence and effect of this limitation of the symbiotic social order by the cultural. Different social sciences are concerned with the forms which this limitation of the natural or ecological social order assumes on (1) the economic, (2) the political, and (3) the moral level."

This article take slocal culture to be part of the objective world, directly visible in such artifacts as statues, street names, or bumper stickers. Experts can and do claim to understand these artifacts, and their claims, rather than mass sentiments, are what count in establishing their meaning. If we take this view, we can begin to build a plausible account of the durability of local American urban cultures, of the strong images that seem to be attributed to our ""shock cities,"" and of the resistance some places show to land conversion and redevelopment. Such a conception of local culture makes it, not a residual left over after economic analysis has its say, but an integral element in an ecological approach which increasingly draws implicitly or explicitly on social as well as economic differences in explaining our urban society."

First, what are the mechanisms through which neighborhood structural composition is related to health? The results show that mechanisms related to stress and adaptation (violent crime, reciprocal exchange and participation in local voluntary associations) are the most robust neighborhood‐level predictors of birth weight. Second, are contextual influences on health limited to the immediate neighborhood or do they extend to a wider geographic context? The results show that contextual effects on birth weight extend to the social environment beyond the immediate neighborhood, even after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. These findings suggest that the theoretical understanding and empirical estimation of “neighborhood effects” on health are bolstered by collecting data on more causally proximate social processes and by taking into account spatial interdependencies among neighborhoods."

The authors predict that countries boost the independence of their central bank from the political power as their exposure to foreign trade, investment, and multilateral lending increases. They also model the cross‐national dynamic process of diffusion of central bank independence by examining the impact of cohesive and role‐equivalent trade relationships between countries. They find support for their hypotheses with information on 71 countries between 1990 and 2000."

These groups recruit individuals with aspirations for social and economic improvement who are without a network of secular relationships to aid them in time of emergency and help them obtain better social and economic positions. In comparison with Catholics, Protestants are younger and more likely to be self-employed. They also are more likely to be migrants who have few family ties in the city. The social organization of neighborhood Protestant groups entails encompassing moral and secular relationships that effectively provide for members' economic and social needs. The effects of these groups under the conditions of Guatemala City are to provide economic security rather than rapid economic improvement and to withdraw members from overt political co-operation with people of similar social and economic position."

Recently released audio recordings are used to argue that the key conversational activity was storytelling about an uncertain future. Kennedy’s choice of a blockade hinged on the narrative “suppression” of its most dangerous possible consequence, namely the perils of a later attack against operational missiles, something accomplished through omission, self-censorship, ambiguation, uptake failure, and narrative interdiction. The article makes the very first connection between the localized dynamics of conversation and decision making in times of crisis, and offers a novel processual account of one of the most fateful decisions in human history."

The comparative success of Thailand's bureaucrats and failure of China's can be illuminated in part by considering differences in relationship to the world system, although this is by no means a sufficient explanation.

Its actual analysis, however, from this standpoint is difficult. Several distinct strands may be detected in what looks at first sight like an integral phenomenon. The social norm is always to be distinguished from the individual increment of expression, which is never discernible in itself, but only as measured against this norm. Moreover, ""speech"" consists of at least five levels of behavior, the expressive value of any one of which need not be confirmed by all the others. These levels are the voice as such, speech dynamics, the pronunciation, the vocabulary, and the style of connected utterance. Owing to the possibility of detecting conflict and other symptomatic reactions in speech, language behavior becomes a suggestive field for research in problems of personality."

From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the “epistemic accident,” grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."

McCarthy,American Journal of Sociology,114,1,2008-07-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 35-76,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Analysts have shown increased interest in how social movements use tactical repertoires strategically. While the state is most often the guarantor of new benefits, many movements—from labor to the environmental movement—target corporate, educational, and other institutions. Employing a unique data set of protests reported in the New York Times (1960–90), this research examines how repertoires are, in part, contingent on the institutional target a movement selects. In particular, the authors consider the role of each target's vulnerabilities and its capacities for response—repression, facilitation, and routinization—as explanations for the degree of transgressive protest each target faces. The results provide strong evidence for considering targets as a central factor in shaping forms of social protest."

Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a “moving target,” with state and societal actors building on legal as well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced explanations of state policy that are both “political” and “institutional” and that highlight the centrality of legal interpretation and judicial review to political sociology."

The movements combine (1) an extraordinarily broad agenda, (2) a strict, morally absolutist ideology, and (3) a strong proscription against compromise with other groups, each of which has been identified as a liability that can lead to movement failure. Through inductive, qualitative analyses, the authors identify four shared strategies that helped these movements overcome these obstacles: bypassing the state, building grassroots structures, providing graduated membership, and reprioritizing agendas. Analyses of these movements also suggest that particular combinations of movement “liabilities” may actually be advantageous."

Fernandez,American Journal of Sociology,107,2,2001-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 273-320,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"One of the most popular explanations for the increased wage inequality that has occurred since the late 1970s is that technological change has resulted in a downward shift in the demand for low‐skill workers. This pattern is also alleged to account for the growth in racial inequality in wages over the same period. This article reports on a case study of the retooling of a food processing plant. A unique, longitudinal, multimethod design reveals the nature of the technological change, the changes in job requirements, and the mechanisms by which the changes affect the wage distribution for hourly production workers. This research finds that, indeed, the retooling resulted in greater wage dispersion and that the changes have also been associated with greater racial inequality in wages. However, contrary to the claims of advocates of the skill‐bias hypothesis, organizational and human resources factors strongly mediated the impact of the changing technology. Absent these “high road” organizational choices, this impact on wage distribution would have been even more extreme."

Clinical procedure is characterized by the case method, co-operative work, and a therapeutic aim. The emerging field of clinical sociology can be of value to practice as well as science. Clinical sociology and social psychiatry.-In the organization of clinics psychiatrists have played the leading role. Until recently, in the absence of sociologists, the social workers have been the only representatives of the social sciences. Social psychiatry, distinguished by the situational approach, is in the course of development. The division of labor between social psychiatry and clinical sociology is in need of clarification. The cultural approach.-While a sociological clinic is as unthinkable as a psychiatric clinic, each specialist has a distinctive point of view, and the sociologists have made a contribution through the cultural approach, which is based upon the conception that behavior becomes a problem when it represents a deviation from the definitions prevailing in a cultural milieu, and can be understood and controlled only in terms of this cultural background. Through the sociological conception of personality which emphasizes social status and the playing of roles in social groups many forms of conduct become intelligible. The scope of clinical sociology.-Research, consulation with and training of other specialists, and direct participation in study and treatment of cases are possible tasks of sociologists in clinics. The work with problems of personality and community life which the sociologists undertakes is not at present carried on except incidentally and directly. The manipulation of the social world and the modification of attitudes are the chief therapeutic problems sociologist. Social worker, in addition to their present training, need training in clinical sociology. Freedom from dogma and cultism, an experimental attitude, and awareness of their own limitations on the part of sociologists are necessary in clinical work."

The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."

The effects of the depression on the individual families are largely determined by the fundamental characteristic of each family prior to its economic collapse. Thus we find trends toward family demoralization and toward a record of family unity and loyalty. Increased tension, desertions, drinking, vice, and mental abnormality reveal the first; and sacrifice, more use of the home, and a wiser philosophy of living express the second trend. Especially significant have been the influences operating upon children and youth. There is nearly universal conviction that direct relief has hurt family life. Newspaper publicity and propaganda led to excessive expectations and these, unfulfilled, have encouragen feelings of disillussionment. The various forms of work-relief have been beneficial in contrast with the dole."

Labor market segmentation implies priviliges, and these, in turn, provide for class alliances aimed at perpetuating segmentation. Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285"

Although most discussions of case study research presume that cases contribute to explanatory theory, this article draws from recent literature about ethical reasoning to argue that case studies can also contribute to normative theory—to theories about the ideals we should pursue and the obligations we should accept. This conclusion suggests that contrary to some views (notably Max Weber’s) social science has a vital role to play in the prescriptive study of values, particularly so‐called “thick ethical concepts” like “leadership,” “courage,” and “neighborhood vitality.”"

Homogamy and in-marriage are not characteristic of the social strata in African states, which tend to encourage marriage between groups of different status, hence these groups tend not to develop in isolation with distinctive modes of life. Out-marriage and bridewealth in Africa stand in contrast to in-marriage and dowry in Eurasia. It is suggested that the more intesive form of agriculture in the latter area encouraged the preservation of familial status by the transmission, inter alia, of property ot females (e.g., the dowry) as well as males, a procedure which strongly encourages the marriage of like with like. In africa, out-marriage strengthens the social ties and cultural similarities within a society. As a consequence, ""class conflict"" was less significant in the political system, although the situation is now changing in the ""modern"" sector."

However, there are different levels of distinctness, some more subtle than others. These levels are determined by the theoretical context of the research. Failure to specify the theoretical context creates ambiguity as to the level of distinctness, and leads to the partialling fallacy, in which one controls for variables that are  distinct in terms of appropriate theory. Although this can occur in using any control procedure, it is especially likely to occur in multiple regression, where high-order partial regression coefficients are routinely obtained in order to determine the relative importance of variables. Four major ways in which these regression coefficients can be seriously misleading are discussed. Although warnings concerning multicollinearity are to be found in statistics texts, they are insufficiently informative to prevent the mistakes described here. This is because the problem is essentially one of substantive interpretation rather than one of mathematical statistics per se."

Beginning with the claim that historians of sociology need to look beyond the now-famous ideas that appear in the foreground of the works of the sociological masters, the article examines the neglected idea of habit to document that this concept was long a staple term in the conceptual vocabulary of Western social theorists and that it continued to function as a major background factor in the substantive writings of both Emile Durkheim and Max Weber-a factor that previous scholarship on Durkheim and Weber has almost completely overlooked. It is shown that Durkheim viewed habit not only as a chief determinant of human action in a great variety of areas but also as one of the principal supports for the moral fabric of modern societies. Similarly, habit is found to be significant in Weber's treatment of modern economic and political life, Calvinism and the spirit of capitalism, and the force of traditionalism, which is so central a factor in his framework for comparative-historical analysis. Although the idea of habit was also used extensively in American sociology down to around 1918, in the course of the two decades that followed the concept was purpose fully excised from the conceptual structure of the field. This dramatic change is shown to be a result of the interdisciplinary disputes that surrounded the institutionalization of sociology as an academic."

This article brings out his three-way relationship in its full dialectical complexity by applying a semiotic approach to meaning as it is created, communicated, and ideologically managed. The semiotic approach is contrasted with Marxian hegemony theory. Because cultural objects mean different things to different social groups, only semiotic analysis fully specifies the multiplicity of meanings involved in mass culture. The semiotic model views meaning as being exchanged in three separate and qualitatively different stages. Its application results in the proposal for a different kind of textual analysis than that used by contemporary mass culture analysts and in the observation that users of mass culture are more active and creative than previously supposed."

This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high‐risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites—a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority—assume an oppositional posture. Explaining variation in mobilization outcomes thus requires examining whether communal elites have gained political salience and retained political autonomy through long‐term processes of political development."

Using organizational data and employment records, the authors model the association between organizational merger and the introduction of career‐migration among employees at Lloyds Bank over a 45‐year period. The pattern of mobility they find suggests that agency problems associated with the loyalties of newly acquired workers dominated early experiments with lateral transfers. As the merger wave matured, geographic mobility became a general feature of all bank workers’ careers. The implications of this pattern of mobility for organizations, career structures, and stratification systems more generally are examined."

The hypothesis is that overaggression represents only a small part of the Negro's hostility. Behind the loyalty of the faithful slave and behind the meekness of the deferential, humble, freed Negro may lie concealed aggression and hostility. This hypothesis is arrived at throught a functional comparison of the psychoanalytical analysis of the dependency situation of the child with that of the slave, and the psychoanalytical analys is of the problem of masochism with that of the meek, fre Negro. There is no structural similarity in either comparison, but the functional comparison offers a clue to understanding the strength of the concealed hostility behind these two roles and the compensations they offer. The second role, which has persisted through today is diminishing in frequency because the cultural and psychological compensations are gradually disappearing."

Local governments with smaller industrial bases have clearer financial incentives and constraints, fewer nonfinancial interests in enterprises, and a greater capacity to monitor them. In China's vast public sector, the fastest growth in output and productivity has occurred where government ownership rights are clearest and most easily enforced, which enables officials to manage public industry as a diversified market-oriented firm."

An analysis of the job histories of new hires into multiple work groups within a single firm reveals path dependence in the effects of group composition on turnover. Exit rates are inversely related to the level of same‐race representation at the time of organizational entry and increase when workers experience declines in same‐race representation. However, turnover rates do not decline in response to increases in representation. The results suggest that initial token status can have a lasting impact on attachment and that increases in attachment in integrated groups occur through a cohort‐replacement process. The turnover dynamics also imply that any gains in the representation of minority groups are very fragile. The challenge of workplace racial integration therefore lies not simply in eliminating discrimination in hiring, but also in managing the post‐hire consequences of changes in group composition. Implications of the asymmetric effects of compositional change for the literature on organizational demography are also discussed."

Somewhere between the two extremes on the base line will be a neutral zone representing indifferent attitudes on the issue in question. The ordinates of the frequency distribution will represent the relative popularity of each attitude.

For the present problem we are limited to those aspects of attitudes for which one can compare individuals by the ""more and less"" type of judgment. For example, we say understandingly that one man is more in favor of prohibition than another, more strongly in favor of the League of Nations than another, more militaristic than some other, more religious than another. The measurement is effected by the indorsement or rejection of statements of opinion. The opinions are allocated to different positions on the base line in accordance with the attitudes which they express. The ordinates of the frequency distribution are determined by the frequency with which each of the scaled opinions is indorsed. The center of the whole problem lies in the definition of a unit of measurement for the base line. The scale is so constructed that two opinions separated by a unit distance on the base line seem to differ as much in the attitude variable involved as any other two opinions on the scale which are also separated by a unit distance. This is the main idea of the present scale construction. The true allocation of an individual to a position on an attitude scale is an abstraction, just as the true length of a chalk line, or the true temperature of a room, or the true spelling ability of a child, is an abstraction. We estimate the true length of a line, the true temperature of a room, or the true spelling ability of a child, by means of various indices, and it is a commonplace in measurement that all indices do not agree exactly. In allocating an individual to a point on the attitude continuum we may use various indices, such as the opinions that he indores, his overt acts, and his past history, and it is to be expected that discrepancies will appear as the true attitude of the individual is estimated by different indices. The present study is concerned with the allocation of individuals along an attitude continuum based on the opinions that they accept or reject."

This third group seeks identification with the dominant group, although the latter may deny such identification. At the same time, because of the characteristics identifying it with the dominant group, it protests against identification with the subordinate group, to which it holds itself superior, and it achieves a status much above that occupied by the subordinate parent-group. This formula of race, which is descriptive of many situations, may be applied with exactitude to two racial islands in America, the Creoles and the Cajuns, both in Alabama. Although quite different in social traits and qualities-in industry, in thrift and cleanliness, in social organization, in intellectual ability, in culture-these two groups are alike in having to occupy distinctive social positions, on the one hand disclaimed by their white parent-groups and on the other hand themselves disclaiming their Negro parents. They equally demonstrate the applicability of the formula of race in America."

There have been three successive eras of Marxian thought: the era of Marx himself, 1840s-1883; the era of ""orthodox"" Marxism, from ca. 1880 to ca. 1950; and the era of a thousand Marxisms, 1950s, on. Each Marxian era is correlated with one of the three attitudes toward utopia. Parallel to the three eras of Marxian thought are three eras of social science: the philosophic era, the scientific era, and a new and as yet unnamed era. The implications of being in the third era of utopias, of Marxisms, and of the social sciences are explored."

Taking friendship as prototyical os such relations, this essay considers the contributions of the Scottish Enlightenment to the study of personal relations in historical and modern times."

The object of so-called ""sychic warfare"" is to destroy morale, particularly the morale of the civil population. The effect has been, when successful, to paralyze the national will, making collective action impossible. Nations exist only when and in so far as they are able to act. The methods of creating national solidarity and for destroying it are abundantly illustrated in recent events in Europe. Propaganda is ordinarily the weapon with which civilian morales is destroyed, if not created. With the more extensive use of the arts and devices of psychic warfare, war has tended to assume the character of a dialectic process, in which it appears not as a struggle of physical forces merely but ideas and ideologies. News makes public opinion; but public opinion is sometimes, if not always inimical morale. It is inimical to morale when it tends to intensify differences of attitude and opinion. But discussion, upon which public opinion is based, in so far as it brings into the open sentiments and attitudes that would otherwise be suppressed, tends to bring about understanding and unity. By so doing it improves morale. War and conflict may be said to function when they bring about an understanding upon which a secure peace may be based."

While French food retains high status, gourmet food can now come from a broad range of cuisines.

The authors take gourmet food writing as a case study to understand the rationales underlying omnivorousness. Their findings, based on qualitative and quantitative data, reveal two frames used to valorize a limited number of foods: authenticity and exoticism. These frames resolve a tension between an inclusionary ideology of democratic cultural consumption on the one hand, and an exclusionary ideology of taste and distinction on the other. This article advances our understanding of how cultural consumption sustains status distinctions in the face of eroding boundaries between highbrow and lowbrow culture."

Data for an empirical test of several propositions were drawn from a content analysisof letters written by clients of the Israeli customs authorities. Indices of role specificity are developed, based on analysis of the persuasive appeals clients offered in support of their requests. Lacking direct information on the three factors mentioned above, we used five personal and social characteristics of clients to predict whether they would maintain role specificity vis-a-vis customs officials. The client's occupation proved to be the best predictor of role specificity, probably because it best reflects the three factors promoting bureaucratic socialization."

Interestingly, the behavioral effects of the project are greatest for the male volunteers. But it is the female volunteers who attribute the greatest personal significance to the project. It is suggested that this seeming paradox can be explained by two factors: (1) the more extensive histories of activism the female volunteers brought to the project and (2) the significance assigned to the project in feminist accounts of the origins of the women's liberation movement."

A review of recent research shows that Chinese society and other similar societies follow rules that deviate from those of the West. In such societies, norms of reciprocity (bao) are intense, but these norms are heavily shaped by the hierarchically structured network of social relations (guanxi) in which people are embedded, by the public nature of obligations, and by the long time period over which obligations are incurred through a self-conscious manipulation of face and related symbols. These special cultural symbols, as well as the historical monopoly of valuable resources by powerful leaders, help explain he origin of these patterns. There are several forces leading to change but also some sources of continuity, which help maintain these patterns regardless of political and economic context."

The present paper presents a model of justice norms as congnitions and tests the degree of cognitive consensus on the norm of just deserts (i.e., ""letting the punishment fit the crime""). It is argued that consensus on justice norms should be tested using a combination of within-respondent and between-respondent techniques. Such tests can (1) simultaneously reveal the presence of consensus on the justice principle involved and on the evaluation of the specific social stimuli presented, (2) facilitate demographic comparisons on adhering to principle or agreeing on facts, and (3) reveal conflicts between these two versions of consensus. For testing the norm of just deserts, ratio scale measures of crime seriousness and punishment severity were employed, and a formula derived from both equity theory and psychophysics was utilized in model fitting. Results from a sample survey indicated dramatically strong use of the principle of just deserts by members of the public but less adherence to just deserts by demographically disadvantaged (low-income or black) respondents. A path model of the relation between aggregate and individual scores further demonstrated a fundamental tension between the two versions of normative consensus, in that the more respondents used the principle the more systematically they deviated from the group average response. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of both the substantive findings and the new methodologies employed for understanding normative consensus and the assessment of justice norms."

The latter model can be used to analyze adaptive strategies groups resort to in competitive situations, such as occur during modernization. At one extreme, groups may maximize their relative population size and use political means to claim and hold a share of a society's resources. This strategy is well known, and several theorists emphasize the advantages of large relative size in ethnic group relations. This paper focuses on the strategy at the other end of the continuum. Bioecologists use the term ""r-strategists"" to refer to especies which maximize their ability to discover ephemeral resources, exploit them quickly, and then disperse in search of new resources. Gypsies and Travellers in modern states are discussed as examples of ethnic r-strategists. These groups are seen to maximize their ability to discover and exploit resources which are irregular in space and time and subject to numerous and varying local constraints through their nomadism and flexible organization. The analysis illustrates the environmental conditions under which r-selection occurs among ethnic groups and identifies some of the characteristics of these groups which may contribute to their success."

This variation affects the ability of the agencies to compete for federal funds. Agencies in wealthier states can afford to pay higher salaries and provide unemployment insurance for a greater proportion of the total unemployed. Such mechanisms allow these agencies to obtain a disproportionate share of the limited federal tax funds in spite of the attempts of the federal government to equalize the economic burdens of the employment program. The stratification system in which the employment agencies exist also affects the tasks which they pursue. Employment agencies in wealthier states concentrate on unemployment-compensation tasks, while those in poorer states emphasize placement services. It is demostrated that, aside from other factors, emphasis on unemployment functions (which wealthy states can more easily afford) has positive feedback effects on the share of federal tax money which a state receives."

Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers."

In the competition and conflict of segments in movement the organization of the profession shifts."

This study finds that Brazilians understand the discriminatory basis of inequality and that an attitudinal dimension associated with racial democracy strongly increases the likelihood of that understanding. Negative stereotyping produces a smaller opposite effect, and “race” is not a significant predictor. Finally, Brazilian and American racial attitudes differ considerably in explaining black disadvantage. These findings question perceptions of Brazilian racial attitudes and the efficacy of dominant theories for their analysis, suggesting a context‐driven approach to theorizing and for antidiscrimination strategizing."

The comparative interest focused on two features: (1) the presumed sharper discontinuity of French class structure compared with the more diffuse American system; and (2) the supposed differences in mobility attitudes in the two countries. Structure and attitudes are commonly taken as conditioners of the mobility experience, moderating or heightening its hypothesized effects on (for example) feelings of social isolation, ethnic prejudice, sense of relative deprivation, and political radicalism or conservatism. The analysis, however, argues strongly in support of French-American similarity rather than difference, in two major respects: (1) mobility attitudes showed the same basic structure and correlation pattern; and (2) as expected, the effects which can be attributed to objective mobility were highly limited in both countries."

Competing causal claims have been the subject of considerable disagreement, culminating in the debate between Clampet‐Lundquist and Massey and Ludwig et al. in this issue. This article assesses the debate by clarifying analytically distinct questions posed by neighborhood‐level theories, reconceptualizing selection bias as a fundamental social process worthy of study in its own right rather than a statistical nuisance, and reconsidering the scientific method of experimentation, and hence causality, in the social world of the city. The author also analyzes MTO and independent survey data from Chicago to examine trajectories of residential attainment. Although MTO provides crucial leverage for estimating neighborhood effects on individuals, as proponents rightly claim, this study demonstrates the implications imposed by a stratified urban structure and how MTO simultaneously provides a new window on the social reproduction of concentrated inequality."

Parents' education, main earner's occupation, and geographical origin contributed to these inequalities. Gender preferences for men were removed, and for some transitions reversed. Although secondary education grew rapidly, higher education failed to keep pace. This disparity led to a university-level enrollment squeeze, and the resulting bottleneck hurt disadvantaged classes more than advantaged ones. In turn the effect of social origins on entering university increased after 1965. The upshot was no net change in the origin-based differences in likelihood of attaining a VUZ degree across three postwar cohorts."

The Indian, the Negro, the Oriental, and particularly the European immigrants and their descendants constitute our principal minorities. The great number, the dense concentration, and the isolated group life of some of these, together with their subordinate social position and the consequences of our past Amerivanization policies, raise questions about our national solidarity. The disadvantaged position of our minorities lends itself redily to exploitation by foreign governments. The Nazis and Fascists have employed a propaganda and orgaizational campaign designed for American conditions. Their appeals are directed in part to the minorities, in part to the dominant groups. The situation thus crated inclines us to adopt remedial and precautionary measures, some of which are ill advised. Our strategy of morale-building might well capitalize on the diverse origin of our people and our democratic traditions. Our experience in the last war and the lessons learned from the conquered nations of Europe suggest a more effective national policy for us. We are likely to get better morale by emphasizing our common aspirations rather than our common memories because, if our minorities can be convinced that their minority status is not permanent and that they can hope to share fully in the promises of democracy, their effort in the national enterprise can be relied upon."

Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult.

Because their sex status is defined within the culture of professions as inappropriate, women find that the institutionalized channels of recruitment and advancement, such as the protege system, are not available to them. Various modes of behavior on the part of women and their colleagues are described which are consequences of women's minority position and which reinforce it. Social changes affecting the traditional structures and opening careers in the professional hierarchy are discussed."

Analyzing unique data on the recruitment and hiring process for customer service representatives at a telephone service center, all of the factors examined—preapplication choices, gender homophilous networks, and screeners’ choices—play significant roles in the gender segregation of this job. The analyses also show that making inferences about prehire processes on the basis of posthire data can be misleading. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and methodological implications of these findings."

It means, moreover, that nations, like individuals, are obliged to love one another. The Catholic church down through the ages has taken a stand midway between professional militarism and absolute pacificism. Virtus stat in medio has its application in this as in most other practical matters. While propounding by preachment and by precept the ideal of universal charity and mutual tolerance in thought and deed, she has not failed to recognize the individual's inalienable right to vigorous self-defense. Likewise, the church recognizes and clearly defines the duty of the state-which is organized for society and not vice-versa-to protect its people and their interests by upholding the adequate sanctions of law and other. The right of santuary, the ""Peace of God,"" the ""Truce of God,"" and many laws regulating warfare are among the concrete achievements of the church in preventing or in mitigating the horrors of war. So too must be counted the efforts of the many popes from early times down to the present day, who have raised their voices to protest against international hatreds and injustices, to mediate in such crises, and to lend their efforts to prevent wars. An approach to the reign of peace and good will on earth will come only through an observance of the doctrines which were promulgated and taught by the church's Founder, the Prince of Peace."

The authors test whether this “strength of weak ties” generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high‐risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially."

Applying this method to two types of communities with the purpose of discovering the basis for such social attitudes as political radicalism and conservatism, we find (I) a uniformity of physical and geographic characteristics, (2) a similarity of demographic conditions, and (3) a high degree of similarity of economic conditions in each type of community. A similar analysis of a radical and conservative community in another state corroborates the findings of the first study."

The author reviews the past treatment of ""action"" in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an empirically grounded account. The account of ""confirming allusions"" is offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of repetition in talk-in-interaction. In conclusion, the significance of both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture and for sociological theory is discussed."

Using data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude, disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational trajectories."

The analysis focuses on three central and interrelated areas of immigrants’ lives—work, family, and schooling—to expose how the criminalization of immigrants at the federal, state, and local levels is not only exclusionary but also generates violent effects for individual immigrants and their families, affecting everyday lives and long-term incorporation processes."

Such influence activities may bring benefits to the organization, but they also involve real costs. This essay offers an economic rationale for such influence activity as representing rational, self-interested behavior in the presence of informational asymmetries and an analysis of how the design of the organization's structure and polices should respond to the incentives for attempting influence. It is posited that information valuable for the organization's decision making is directly available only to members of the organization who have some personal stake in the decisions. These individuals may then have an incentive to try to manipulate the information they develop and provide in order to influence the resulting decision to their benefits. This can be costly both in degrading the quality of decision making and in diverting the attention and effort of the organization's members from more productive activities. The organization has three different methods it can employ to discourage excessive influence activities and to encourage more directly productive uses of time and effort. It can limit access to decision makers and participation in decision making; it can alter its decision-making criteria to favor those performing well in productive activities; and it can provide direct financial incentives to encourage the desired allocation of effort. It is shown that an efficiently deisgned organization will use such financial incentives only as a last resort. Instead, it will always first alter its decision-participation polices and decision-making criteria."

Adequately conceived, the individual's behavior does not terminate in his muscular contractions but includes the objective results accomplished, which are determined by constraining factors in the environment as well as by the individual's muscular activity. The individual becomes adjusted to the objective situation and works toward an objective result, and the members of a team are adjusted to the same situation and work toward the same result. Thus the individual participates in group activity, as he also participates in other environmental happenings such as the motion of a swing. Instead of participationhe may offer resistance to environmental forces. Participation, then, is not forced on the individual but grows out of his fundamental objectivity of outlook and effort. The root of group activity is the individual's tendency to participate."

Fashion does not exist in tribal and classless societies. It concerns externals and superficialities where irrationality does no harm. It signalizes the lack of personal freedom; hence it characterizes the female and the middle class, whose increased social freedom is matched by intense individual subjugation.

This core functioned to control appointments to the medical institutions, to exclude or penalize intruders, to distribute patients, and to enforce rules and control competition. The influence of this inner core is crucially important in the careers of new recruits to medicine. The stages of a medical career are here set forth as a set of adjustments to this inner core and to the institutions it influences."

Can it be also (5) a compound? It cannot be a member of itself for this would violate the ""vicious circle"" principle. It may be said to be homogeneous with its members. But the question is whether the distinguishing functions of a social whole are of the same type as that of a whole man. The principle of unity may be (a) of a different type, (b) quantitatively different, (c) higher than, or (d) lower than, its members. Our minds should be rid of the assumption that a more inclusive whole must be of a higher order. It is possible to regard society as different in type from a man, as was done in the medieval conception of the universal community. Therefore the unity of society is not necessarily the same as unity of mind. Nor is it possible to contend that society and man are quantitatively different. As to higher and lower, the more unified and more versatile are higher, and owing to the complexity of our life a human ""cell"" belongs to many bodies, so that the firm hold on the parts is lost and the unity which distinguishes developed organisms does not exist. Moreover, the approach in mechanized industry to the solidarity of an organism may debase the members of it. It seems clear that the things which a social group can do are less worth doing than what a man at his best can do. Social groups are wholes, but they are wholes of an inferior type. Is society a mind? Yes, if we refer to the lower functions or habits, or abstract functions as unified control but not the higher unities. A caution must be made against personification which leads to superstitious veneration and idolatry. Finally, the social mind must refer to the difference in behavior due to social causes. The social mind is therefore not a new being of a higher order."

Multiple methods of anlysis reveal several systematic biases. In spatial representations individuals' self-perceived positions are closer to the centroid than their group-perceived positions. Graph-theoretic centrally measures show that group members tend to have highest centrality in their own digraphs, and they tend to report more ties, more reciprocated ties, and more transitive triples among those they report, as opposed to those they do not report, as friends. Despite these individuals biases, correspondense analysis provides a valid group-level representation of the friendship network."

This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France."

One model of analysis, that of ""middle-majority politics,"" which emphasized the emergence of middle-class type occupations and the continuous decline of dessensus and ideologically based issues, is rejected. Instead, a model of ""consensus and cleavage"" is offered which assumes a transformation in social-class-based politics but points to the manifestation of political conflict rooted in new and more differentiated social groupings which reflect economic, professional, and bureaucratic interests. Party affiliation is most related to social class in Great Britain, next in west Germany, and least in the United States; in each nation different social-structural variables operated as the secondary basis of cleavages in party affiliation."

Learning disability researchers misconstrued their object of study, unexplained underachievement, interpreting it neurologically and ignoring classroom practices and events and the social forces shaping them as possible causes. As a result the theory masks societal forces as they affect academic performance. Some consequences of this masking for educational knowledge and social policy are considered.

When former college teachers were evaluated, men students ranked women less favorably than men, but women students ranked men less favorably than women. Although a substantial minority of students had no sex preference for instructor in any size of class, among those who did, more preferred men teachers than women, and the larger the class, the greater was the preference for a man teacher. Men were slightly more likely than women to agree with an opinion attributed to a scholar of the same sex. This study fails to support Goldberg's conclusion and points out the need for replication."

It is argued that the major development did not occur until after the publication of Suicide, notwith standing Durkheim's interpreters' persistence in treating Suicide as the final statement of this theory. It is also shown how Durkheim remained most comfortable dealing with microsociological levels of analysis, and how his growing recognition of anomie as a macro-problem rendered it inherently insoluble as a problem, given his practical-humanistic orientation. In this connection, Durkheim's shifting and uncertain remedial proposals-occupational, political, educational, and ""creation and renewal""-are traced and critically analyzed on his own terms."

Because of their approaches to history, both theories recognize only part of the complex reality of modern capitalist culture. Bourdieu's ahistorical structuralism fails to grasp the historical changes produced in culture by capitalism, while critical theory's essentialism fails to specify the concrete factors mediating the historical effects of capitalism on culture. As a corrective to both, a neo-Marxist theory is developed that grasps the totality of capitalist culture by grounding the effects of class on culture in concrete, historical class struggle."

The approach is applied to the aggregate change of mind by the U.S. Senate as it moved from support of the Vietnam war to opposition from 1964 to 1973. Substantively, cumulative war costs, public opinion, and antiwar demonstrations all had significant effects on Senate roll call outcomes, but they were so highly intercorrelated that their separate effects could not be disentangled. In addition, demonstrations taking place in the months before a vote had a slight positive impact on the number of dovish votes received by motions. The 1970 invasion of Cambodia seems to have led to a significant turning point in the way the Senate dealt with the war. The general strengths and weaknesses of the new approach are assessed. It opens a new area to statistical inquiry and generates a number of novel questions that should lead to additional research."

The presumed opposition between authority and markets is not supported by league histories in the four major team sports. These histories show that, contrary to expectations, market potential has the greatest influence on winning when league authority is formally strongest. Market potential has no influence on performance when league authority is opposed by antitrust law, player unions, rival leagues, or league members. To explain this anomaly, authority and market relations must both be seen as embedded within the multiplex relations among team owners. These relations changed dramatically with the rise of national audiences in the past three decades. Inequality among equals replaced inequality among unequals as the support of a rootless national audience replaced rooted and unequal local audiences, altering the opportunity context of owners."

But there are many obstacles to research in this field, viz., the complexity of the material, the paucity of statistical data, the difficulties of controlled experimentation. the existence of dogmatic interpretations, and the corrupt and predatory interests that are adverse to research. Three main lines of inquiry are open to us: legal, statistical, and sociological, Legal research is now being prosecuted relative to the administration of the criminal law; but, at best, the law is somewhat external to problems of criminology. Its outlook is not conspicuously that of science, except where legal procedure has become socialezed. In regard to criminal statistics we may say that the statistical method of accumulation and correlation, while informing us of general tendencies, does not give us causes in specific instances, nor does it reveal the selfhood of the criminal, which is the real criminologic problem. This latter is reached only through a truly sociological method, which interprets behavior in terms of organic impulse and of social conditions, and of their mutually interacting relationship. The two indispensable devices for the sociologist in this matter are the individual case history and the community case history. The technique of the former is well known; that of the latter needs further development and application. Fortunately, research projects are now under way or contemplated, for the correlation of these two forms of the sociologic approach."

This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic‐commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics."

For gender, the process is entirely meritocratic: age and education account for all sex differences. But even without taking into account the two meritocratic variables, there are small if no differences between men and women at all stages in the hiring process. For ethnic minorities, the process is partly meritocratic but partly reliant upon social networks. Once referral method is taken into account, all race effects disappear. In hiring, ethnic minorities are thus disadvantaged in the processes that take place before the organization is contacted.

Black, mulattoes, and whites are to be found participating together on all educational levels. Segregated schools are unknown. African customs and rituals, practiced on the lower-class level and party fused into the culture even at the upper levels, are gradually losing their hold of Negro youth because of disparagement by prestige-bearing members of the European community.

Bombing effects suggested a diversion of aggression from Allies to Nazis and declining morale.

It is, on the other hand, expressive and personal like music. Both forms of communication function in bringing about those understandings between individuals and peoples which are the substance-the warp and woof-of culture. The social function of communication seems to be to bring about and maintain understanding and cultural solidarity among individuals and societies. It may be contrasted with the social function of competition which is to bring about an orderly distribution and a division of labor between individuals and societies. This division of labor, so far as it is brought about by competition, involves the individuation of the competing units. Competition and communication may thus be said to suplement each other, since communication operates as an integrating and socializing principle, while competition is the principles of individuation. More specifically, communication may be said to operate in two dimensions. On the one hand, it serves to bring about a diffusion of cultural traits and so widen the cultural area within which socia relations may exist. On the other hand, communication, in so far as it brings diverse cultural influences into focus at some center of communication, like the rural village or metropolitan city, tends the bring into the common understanding new ideas-ideas that inevitably arise in the ferment, confusion, and conflict of the acculturation process. The processes of diffusion and acculturation seem to take place in the manner and under the conditions in which news is collected and diffused. It is characteristic of news that it circulates as far as its message is understood and seems important. It is probable, however, that the cinema, which circulates not news, but pictures, is more devastating in its effects upon local cultures and in bringing the widely dispersed people of the world within the influence of a single culture of civilization than is the news proper."

Three central contingencies of an initial metamorphosis, from sober dispositions to doing laughter, are specified.

Each of these dimensions is altered when participants undergo a second metamorphosis, a shift to being done by the spirit raised.

It views a retirement village as a relatively ""non-total"" (Goffman 1961) ""people-processing institution"" in which residents themselves devise means for their collective socialization for impending death. I Suggest that we can learn from this setting about the conditions favorable to successful socialization."

Young,American Journal of Sociology,72,6,1967-05-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 589-600,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Incest taboos, defined broadly as prohibitions on emotional alliances among ingroup members, may be interpreted as one of a range of indicators of high solidarity. The ""incest taboo problem"" therefore dissolves because the real object of explanation is solidarity. Specific hypotheses are elaborated and a cross-cultural test of the interpretation is proposed. Functional interpretations that stress the preservation of existing role relations, although superficially similar, are seen to lead to different research consequences. Case material on the emotional aversions among age mates in collective settlements in Israel, between sons and adopted daughters in aiwanese families, and the incestous marriages of Egyptian royalty are interpreted."

In the case of the Pennsylvania German, the Lutheran traditionalism of faith has become a radiant center for the integration of a consciousness of self, of difference and of kind. A historical creed has here rationalized the process of life upon terms of its own. By conditioning an ego it determined the development of its organs of self-preservation, a functional type ideal, a specific societal technique, a language, a school system. It thus determined the performance of that type as a socius: his function in the social constitution and in the creation of values. By indicating distinct mind frontiers, by sanctioning terms of dissociation as well as consociation, religion appears here as the grandam of sectionalism and as a vital condition of the social process in America."

Observations were made of seventy-nine working-and middle-class boys and girls while engaged at two achievement tasks, one with their mothers and the other with their fathers. Children were most likely to cheat when their parents exerted pressure on them to succeed. Parental pressure, in turn, comes about when parents entertain high aspirations for their children coupled with limited resources. Neither high aspirations with more ample material resources nor limited resources with more modest aspirations are as apt to result in parental pressure and its consequent cheating by children. Cheating can thus be an unwitting result of striving after culturally valued goals under conditions of limited opportunity."

The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate‐sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy‐set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate‐sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences."

The authors find no evidence for a proportional increase of NMAOs since the 1960s. Further, among all organizations in three populations—peace, women's issues, and human rights—NMAOs have not displaced MAOs. In particular, the authors find that MAO density shapes NMAO founding, as membership groups provide a base for professional advocacy. These findings challenge the notion that U.S. civic life has undergone a systemic transformation away from organizational forms that promote civic engagement."

The central results are difficult to reconcile with the devaluation hypothesis but are remarkably consistent with the specialized human capital hypothesis."

These relations are analyzed with a unique data set on organizational practices, managerial behavior, and work‐life experiences from 204 English‐language organizational ethnographies. The analyses reveal configurations of practices associated with both positive and negative outcomes for organizations and workers. Configurations associated with organizational success include both positive organizational‐level and positive job‐level practices, such as employee involvement, competent management, and on‐the‐job training. The findings suggest that although the goals of organizational success and worker dignity are sometimes at odds, they can also be complementary."

A research agenda is proposed in which it is suggested that housework is both an ordeal of civility through which individuals judge their joint membership in the same social milieu and an ordeal of conviviality through which individuals who pass within the same milieu reinforce social bonds. The conclusion elucidates why changes in the division of housework should not be synonymous with the eradication of tasks.

What Redfield says of the art of social science is equally true of the art of any science. Sciences are social inventions; they grow up in a very unscientific way. The choice of problems which determines the course that a science will take is personal and reflects the values of the scientist. The humanistic imagination required of social scientists is of the same kind as that required of all scientists. The social scientist has no advantage, and may have a disadvantage, from the fact that he is a human being studying human beings. Physical science can be as liberalizing and enriching as the social sciences and the humanities, depending on the way it is taught."

A new level of social consciousness has developed through a process of emergent evolution. This idea of the relation of the part to other parts and to the whole has meaning also in logic. It is on this idea that the Five-Year Plan is based. But the concept of unity points to a still higher universe of discourse. The power implicit in prehuman evolutionary processes carries through to superhuman levels. The whole is greater than the sum of all its parts."

Early institutions established by Chinese migrants in Hawaii, although based on traditional familial sentiments, represent an expansion of Old World local identifications. Development of nationalistic societies, taking forms corresponding to movements in China, indicate further enlargement of the migrants' social world. Another shift in the area of group loyalties is revealed in the establishment of institutions designed to deal with problems confronting the Chinese community in Hawaii as a whole. Increased identification with the envolving Hawaiian society is represented by individual migrants who became citizens and functionaries of the Hawaiian government. The assimilation of the Hawaiian-born Chinese must be analyzed in terms of this changing configuration of identifications and loyalties of the immigrants."

The two models are equivalent when within-family regressions are the same for each member of the sibling pair.

To a striking degree, the same syndrome of attitudes, values, and ways of acting-such as openness to new experience, independence from parental authority, and taking an active part in civic affairs-defines the modern man in each of the six countries and in all the occupational groups of cultivator, craftsman, and industrial worker. Education is the most powerful factor in making men modern, but occupational experience in large-scale organizations, and especially in factory work, makes a significant contribution in ""schooling"" men in modern attitudes and in teaching them to act like modern men. Those who come from very traditional backgrounds and receive little formal schooling can, under the right circumstances, still become modern in adult life. Modern men in developing countries not only have modern attitudes, but they can be shown to behave differently. Despite popular impressions to the contrary, exposure to the influence of migration and modern institutions does not lead to psychic distress."

B. Macpherson's critique of power in liberal-democratic societies. Macpherson shows that disalienation is possible in Marxist theory only if material abundance or undifferentiated access to the means of production is provided. In contrast, Parsons's approach to the study of modern society emphasizes that differentiated responsibility and authority for production and organization are irreversible and increasing. Because of this systemic trend toward functional differentiation, a single normative standard for recognizing either necessity or abundance in absolute terms cannot be assumed. Parsons's analytical approach to the economic subsystem of the social system also moves him to reject economists' notions of consumer sovereignty and utility. Thus, his schema dismisses a anachronisms bothe the ""absolutism"" of the model of the free market."

Beyond the theoretical analysis, the author attempts to account for the dramatic growth of the white population share in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. Because the effects of racial classification and differential reproduction were roughly offsetting, the observed growth of the white share can be attributed almost entirely to racial switching."

Jurgen Habermas, the leading contemporary critical theorist, has attempted to address this problem in an extensive reconstruction of the theories of Marx and Weber that appropriates elements of American pragmatist thought. Yet he resorts to an evolutionary normative argument that undermines the sociological powers of the two classical theories and contradicts the pragmatists' historical approach to values. This essay explains the significance of Habermasian theory for the emancipatory tradition, analyzes certain problems of the theory, and argues that an expanded dialogue with American pragmatism would strengthen both its sociological and its normative dimensions. Though the explicit focus is on the emancipatory tradition, the essay raises broader critical questions about pseudohistorical, normative justification in general sociological theory."

While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance."

Heise,American Journal of Sociology,109,5,2004-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 1109-1136,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"The authors examine self‐reported emotional experiences of individuals in a large probability sample of Americans, using two theories in the sociology of emotions as lenses to apprehend social order in emotional processes. Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals’ positions in a three‐dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith‐Lovin, MacKinnon), the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social structural, circumstantial, and individual‐level variables. Viewing emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience, structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion management that may have been overlooked in other studies."

Jensen and Thompson's analysis notwithstanding, the core of the power-control model performs well here and in serveral other data sets. Yet further specification of the model is needed in terms of both gender itself and of the family structures and power relationships that establish its scope."

Method and evidence, not subject matter, distinguish articles from books. Private universities ""prefer"" books, while scholars trained at public universities are more likely to publish articles. Gender and rank are associated with choice of genre, while citation rates increase with authors' prior publication records.

Results confirm that even late in life self‐directedness of work continues to affect intellectual functioning and self‐directedness of orientation. These psychological characteristics, in turn, affect social‐structural position in ways that increase disparities between the advantaged and disadvantaged. From a historical and societal perspective, the findings suggest that the occupational self‐directedness of a society’s workers may affect its social norms, values, and modes of production."

Yet, there is little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the relationship between differential socialization and differential religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being irreligious constitutes risk‐taking behavior. This model is able to predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed."

There is a low-rate area in the central business district and the adjacent area of transition, with highrate zones next in order, thence tending toward lower-rate zones as one moves toward the periphery of the city. Marriage rates higher in areas of declining population than in those of increasing population. The areas with lowest rates, in addition to the central business district and the downtown zone of transition, are a river-front area and the choice residential sections near the outer limits of the city. The high-rate areas are densely populated sections dominated usually by Negroes, Russian Jews, and Italians.

In the Tennessee Valley the region of power distribution is different from the flood-control area, and the homogeneous socio-economic subregions also transcend the drainage basin.

Each occupation maintains a sense of superior production (an ""occupational aesthetic"") that is not reducible to organizational demands. This perspective extends the production of culture approach that sees art as being like all work, suggesting, in contrast, that all work is like art. An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task."

The J-curve is characteristic in situations where overconformity is impossible and where the norms is not too difficult for most persons. In other situations skewed normal curves may be expected. For purposes of measuring conformity behavior, a classification of societal norms based on the susceptibility to measurement of deviations from the norms is presented. Suggestions with respect to measuring techniques are also presented."

At the same time, readjustments are taking place not so much from social prevision but as a natural consequence of the use of these newer instrumentalities of communication. Through the motion picture, the aeroplane, and the radio, the individual is participating imaginatively and actually more and more fully in ""the great society."""

This study engages this debate by using international data—including math achievement scores from the Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study and country‐level data from the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Values Survey, and the International Social Survey Programme—to demonstrate the importance of social factors and to estimate an upper bound for the impact of genetic factors. The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross‐national variation in gender differences with country‐level predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women."

However, since it is to the group's interest to have integrated members, the theory must go further to describe how a group makes certain that its members will be and remain approachable to one another. A group solves these problems through control of admission and through minimal norms. A major norm, controlling competition, is demostrated with data from a business office and a factory, and it is shown how office and factory groups differ structurally in means of controlling competition."

This neo‐Meadian perspective contrasts with theories of desistance that focus on the role of informal social controls and develops the view of an emotional self that flourishes somewhat independent of the major role transitions typically emphasized in sociological studies of the life course. The authors also explore ways in which attention to the emotional realms of experience adds to traditional treatments of the impact of adult transition events (e.g., the “good marriage effect”). Interviews with male and female adolescent offenders and two waves of adult follow‐up data document general patterns of association and support the argument that a social view of emotional processes is critical to a comprehensive understanding of life course patterns of criminal continuity and change."

Applying the approach to 48 organizational forms in the health care sector, this study suggests that the development of novel forms is affected by the positioning of their identities with respect to existing form identities in the community, by the aggregate density and size of organizations matching those existing identities, and by the amount of attention directed at identity attributes by sector participants. Findings show that the process of form emergence is subject to population‐dependent effects akin to those noted previously for organizational entries within established populations. The aggregate density and size of organizations with similar identities increase the probability of form emergence to a point (cross‐form legitimation), but highly saturated regions of the identity space tend to be uninviting to new forms (cross‐form competition)."

It suggests that we need to distinguish between experts and expertise as requiring two distinct modes of analysis that are not reducible to one another. It analyzes expertise as a network linking together agents, devices, concepts, and institutional and spatial arrangements. It also suggests rethinking how abstraction and power were analyzed in the sociology of professions. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses. This article shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the deinstitutionalization of mental retardation created a new institutional matrix within which a new set of actors—the parents of children with autism in alliance with psychologists and therapists—were able to forge an alternative network of expertise."

Yet neither approach accounts for the experiences of ostensibly illegal grassroots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in an authoritarian state. Drawing on fieldwork in China, I argue that grassroots NGOs can survive in an authoritarian regime when the state is fragmented and when censorship keeps information local. Moreover, grassroots NGOs survive only insofar as they refrain from democratic claims-making and address social needs that might fuel grievances against the state. For its part, the state tolerates such groups as long as particular state agents can claim credit for any good works while avoiding blame for any problems. Grassroots NGOs and an authoritarian state can thus coexist in a “contingent symbiosis” that—far from pointing to an inevitable democratization—allows ostensibly illegal groups to operate openly while relieving the state of some of its social welfare obligations."

Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage."

Two types of regionalism are distinguished: peripheral sectionalism, based on the salience of a distinctive cultural indentity in a given territory, the periphery; and functional sectionalism, based on the specific social structural composition of a given territory. According to a widely held diffusion model, peripheral sectionalism should decrease following industrialization as regions become integrated into the national society, while functional sectionalism should increase as regions become more economically specialized. Hence, regional political differences are likely to exist both before and after industrialization. An alternate, internal colonial model suggests that peripheral sectionalism is likely to persist despite the effects of industrialization. The adequacy of these models can only be evaluated if these two types of regionalism are empirically differentiated. In this article an indirect method, not employing measures of cultural variables, is presented to distinguish between peripheral and functional sectionalism. Using this method, it is determined that peripheral sectionalism has not decreased following industrialization in the Celtic regions of the diffusion model. It is suggested that this theory is inadequate in its failure to consider the political utility of culture maintenance to groups in peripheral regions."

This study is an experimental rather than a polemical attempt to determine the relative accuary of the two modes of prediction. A restricted form of behavior-academic success-was predicted from clinical (case-study) material and from a previously derived regression equation. The correlation coefficients demonstrate that the case-study method which presumably accounts for an innumerable asortment of variables is no more accurate than a simple statistical method which accounts for only two variables. Analysis of the predictions suggests that the case-study method takes behavior segments with known predictive weights and applies other weights which are less efficient. Case-study predictions-at least on the grounds of efficiency-should not be substituted for actuarial predictions. As a complement to the actuarial predictions, the clinical predictions add nothing. The posibility of generelizing to the prediction of other kinds of critera is discussed."

When local solidarities are ignored, the weakness of conventional aggregate models is easily misinterpreted as evidence of generic destructuration, and standard postmodernist formulations are accordingly difficult to resist. Although local structuration is often regarded as sociologically trivial, the available evidence suggests that such class analytic processes as closure, exploitation, and collective action emerge more clearly at the level of disaggregate occupations than conventional aggregate classes."

Since the government of county, township, and village exists primarily for farmers, a better approach would seem to be examine the economic status and the psychological equipment of the rural population. The problem of rural government will grow in importance since it will involve fitting rural society into a pattern created by urban and industrial forces. Rural government is at present badly adjusted to its tasks. The general property tax has broken down, population is declining while costs remain stationary, tax delinquency is a permanent problem, and a policy for the wise use of land is yet to be formulated. Probable developments in the future are: (I) increasing state control of local functions; (2) the adoption of scientific administration; (3) the widening of the areas of administration in rural sections. Rural attitudes at present do not favor the suggested changes in the direction of permanence, professionalim, and hierarchical organization in governmental services or the adoption of the generally accepted standards of sound administration. An examination of such factors would seem to be more promising than the traditional lines of attack."

Statistical description might be employed as a supplementary technique. The study of one of these groups, the Amana Society, in southeastern Iowa, raises and answers some interesting questions. It had its origin in the general sectarian movement of post-Reformation Germany. its history and development exhibit a definite sequence of processes, a cycle from assimilation to assimilation. An analysis of these processes throws light upon the evolution of a culture and the problems of social origin and social change. Life-histories supplement this description on the subjective side. The communistic practice of the community seems to have little effect upon family organization, which is predominatly patriarchal. Some evidence of its influence is seen in the field of religion. Conclusions in regard to its results upon human nature indefinite. Deductions as to these and other persistent problems of sociology need to be checked by a study of other similar groups."

In this study the author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, “structural availability” works not only by freeing an actor from conformity‐inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations."

Calverton,American Journal of Sociology,35,3,1929-11-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 383-392,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Trotsky's work as a critic has been devoted to an attempt to correct the extremes of revolutionary writers and to insist that the total annihilation of bourgeois culture was impossible. He opposed the program to level art to the comprehension of the proletarian, holding that the new freedom would raise the standards and multiply the interests of the workers. His was a militant attack on the concept of a proletarian culture. A sharp opposition to him has developed, Lunacharsky insisting that at least in a transition stage a distinctive class art was necessary. Other bolshevik critics have opposed his position. While events in the development of the art of Russia have confirmed the position of his opponents, Trotsky's contribution to sociological aesthetics remains highly significant."

Roth,American Journal of Sociology,77,5,1972-03-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 839-856,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"One important aspect of the control of behavior of patients and visitors on a hospital emergency service is the moral evaluation of the clients made by the staff. Such evaluation arises from the application of concepts of social worth common in the larger society and from staff concepts of appropriate work role. The process, however, is not a simple cause-effect matter, but the product of a reciprocal relationship between the attributes of the client and the categories of the staff. Emergency-department staff, like other service occupations, attempt to establish mechanisms of control over inappropriate demands for service."

The argument here presented counters this emerging consensus. Reexamining the case of the Israeli kibbutzim, the authors show that individuals who grew up in the kibbutzim's communal education system were in fact often attracted to their peers, and only rarely did they develop sexual aversion toward these peers. This article offers an alternative explanation to the problem of incest avoidance and the incest taboo, one that brings sociological factors back into the picture."

A comparative ethnographic approach is used to observe shifts in the discussions of four fledgling activist groups. In each group, implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events, authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group’s sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new understanding of the role of contingency in collective activism and a method for using ethnographic observation to locate subtle causal mechanisms in social life."

Gordon,American Journal of Sociology,73,1,1967-07-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 42-62,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Gradients ordering lower-class gang, lower-class non-gang, and middle-class responses to a semantic differential are interpreted as reflecting differences in rewards from interpersonal relations due to differences in the prevalence of psychopathology. Support is found in other studies and in other data. The theoretical inference is made that in groups in which interpersonal relations are insufficiently rewarding to be self-sustaining, group cohesiveness will depend upon activities that are facilitated, rather than hindered, by such personal limitations. Evidence in the literature suggests that the delinquent activities of gangs perform this latent function."
