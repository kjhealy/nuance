Garnier,American Journal of Sociology,91,2,1985-09-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 250-280,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"Through an analysis of a large survey of employment men and women in France, this article shows that French reproduction theory has overstated the role of education in reproducing class advantage from generation to generation. Among men, reproduction of control over labor power (i.e., managerial/supervisory positions) is primarily direct instead of indirect through education. At the same time, education plays no role in reproducing ownership of businesses (i.e., capitalist and petty bourgeois positions), and there is little tendency for capitalist or petty bourgeois fathers to convert their economic capital into the educational capital for their sons so that the sons can secure managerial positions. Education serves less as a reproducer of class advantage than as a vehicle of mobility into managerial positions. Although reproduction theory has tended to ignore gender differences in class reproduction , these are found to be substantial. In the reproduction of ownership, women are less likely than men to inherit a business from their father. In the reproduction of control over labor power, the considerations that are important to men's chances of acquiring managerial/supervisory positions are generally much less important to women's chances. Thus reproduction strategis that are succesful in perpetuating class privilege for men do not work as well for women."

The resulting SSIC scores are based solely on observed mobility among detailed occupational categories. These scores are quite similar to socioeconomic index (SEI) scores. and somewhat less similar to NORC occupational prestige scores. The SSIC values closely match average offspring's SEIs and average father's SEIs for each category, although no information about SEI or its components is employed in their calculation. This fundamentalist approach to measuring inheritance without a priori scaling reveals that mediation of occupational inheritance by education is outweighed by direct ""ascriptive"" transmission."

In contrast, Merton and his associates, in their studies of medical and law schools, propose that students gradually acquire the self-concept of ""professional."" The issue is important to the theory of adult socialization. Music conservatories afford an excellent test case because music students engage in professional activities while they are still in school. Multivariate analyses of the effects of professional activity and the effects of the music school suggest that both actual professional activity and the professional school itself contribute to the development of a professional selfconcept. But the variables interact. Students who do not engage in ""clinical"" activities (professional work) do not generally acquire a high self-concept. Much of the effect of the music conservatories is not through direct social contacts with teachers or students. Rather, students acquire musical skills which are the prerequisite for professional work and for symbolic rewards, both of which lead to a professional self-concept."

Speaking in terms of collectivity is alluring; but it is description, not explanation. Social organism metaphors, group-mind theories, and the like never lead beyond themselves, nor serve to reveal causation. The group fallacy defined.-This fallacy consists in substituting the group for the individual as a principle of explanation. The group concept may be phrased in either psychological or ""purely social"" terms. Illustrations are drawn from the following fields. I. Social conflict. Freudian repression and dissociation are terms applicable only to individuals. There is a wide divergence of meaning between mental conflict and social conflict. 2. Revolution. Here the fallacy is expressed in such group terms as immobility of society and breakdown of ""social habits."" These terms are merely descriptive, drawing attention away from the truly causal behavior of individuals. 3. The theory of the super-organic. The concept of a causal science on a purely social (non-psychological) plane is untenable, because in all science explanation is possible only by drawing upon the concepts of sciences at more elementary levels. In practice also no one has succeeded in formulating a science of this sort. Culture history is not culture explanation; much less is it an adequate explanation of social change. The true basis for sociology is the social behavior of he socialized individual, in other words, social psychology. The Work of sociology is to describe collectivities of social behavior and social change resulting from it in terms of the group, and to explain these phenomena in terms of the individual."

Are these neighborhood preferences color‐blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."

This variation is explained by a model of path‐dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work."

This article examines the use of these frames in Renaissance patronage‐seeking letters, both quantitatively (through multidimensional scaling) and qualitatively (using discourse analytical concepts), to present an interactionist approach to the presentation of self and, in turn, to political culture.

Thesse are most useful ways to deal with men in civic life; therefore listen well to me. (Alberti 1969, p. 252)   I certainly agree, Lionardo, that the things Piero said all seemed to be wise and sound and full of prudense. His subtlety and considerable artistry were also clear to me…. But it seems to me that I want some other sort of thread and texture in talk on this subject…. You know the truth–how can anyone dream that mere simplicity and goodness will get him friends, or even acquaintancs not actually harmful and annoying?…. The world is amply supplied with fraudulent, false, perfidious, bold, audacious, and rapacious men. Everything in the world is profoundly unsure…. The deal with human wickedness in all its boldness, daring, and greed one must beable to remain constant, temperate, and full of inner strength. These are the qualities I would like to see actually practiced by a man whose friendship I hoped to gain and enjoy…. So there it is; I want to be instructed in this sense concerning friendship, how to obtain it, increase it, diminish it, recover it, and make it permanent. (1969, pp. 264–67)"

This empirical account explains the transition in political communication from norms of secrecy to appeals to public opinion. Popular communicative change in the English Revolution anticipated, in practice, the democratic theory of the public sphere when printing transformed a traditional instrument of communication-the petition. Petitions had medieval origins and traditions that upheld norms of secrecy and privilege in political communication. Economic and technical properties of printing-namely, heightened commercialism and the capacity to reproduce texts-demolished these norms by changing the scope and content of communication by petition. This practical innovation appears in all factions in the revolution. But among radical groups, the political use of printed petitions led to novel theories and to democratic speculation on constitutional provisions that would ensure the authority of public opinion in politics. This analysis contradicts key assumptions on communicative change that fuel pessimistic assessments of the modern public sphere in post-modernism and critical theory."

The application of psychology to the study of culture resolves itself to the study of individuals in terms of cultural situations in which individual behavior goes on. From this point of view, the study of culture becomes a problem in the study of cultural types. Adapting biological terminology to our need, we may call them ""variants,"" ""hybrids,"" and ""mutants."" The ""variant"" is a group functionary whose task is to dispose of the accumulating cultural lags by maintaining some degree of consistency between the philosophy and practices prevailing in the group. The""hybrid"" is a form of discontinuous variant whose function is to adapt borrowed culture forms to the prevailing forms in his own group. The ""mutant"" is a genius-leader who conceives his task to be the change of the fundamental pattern of a given culture. Thus do the cultural types, themselves determined by culture, explain the several aspects of the problem of culture change."

This constitutive difficulty presents itself today in ways that have instructive parallels to the problem constellation confronting the first generation of 20th-century sociological classics. Karl Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929) was extraordinarily successful in Germany at the historical turning point of the Weimar Republic. This marks him as a representative figure among those contemporaries who acknowledged the force of ""irrationalist"" criticisms of progressive liberalism but sought to contain the destructive dynamics of such criticisms within a new type of rational framework, both intellectual and political. The article contrasts Mannheim's encounters with antirationalist thought in Ideologie un Utopie with the later pragmatist instrumental rationalism of his writings in English exile. In analyzing the shift, special attention is paid to Mannheim's involvement in Paul Tillich's religious socialist circle and to confrontations between Mannheim and Georg Lukacs, Oscar jaszi, Eduard Heimann, Max Hrkheimer, and Theodor W. Adorno. Newly discovered letters and transcripts are use to specify these relationships. Mannheim's promising theoretical beginnings were disruped by the brute facts of his generation's biography. Learning from Mannheim requires retrieval of his achievements, criticism of its distortions, and renewed start in the direction of his work during the 1920s."

They also show disturbance on evenings and weekends, but during these periods such upsets are very likely to be normal in form. This alternating timetable does not occur in a large state hospital. The difference is accounted for by the weekday presence, in the private hospital, of professional treatment personnel and clinical trainess who are receptive to the revelation of symptoms and react with interest and tolerance. The same process that leads to disapearance of symptoms upon administering a placebo may lead to their emergence if the therapeutic regime promotes it. The finding is additional evidence that the immediate environment influences behavior once thought to be due soley to individuals' internal processes."

This mechanism accounts for patterns of elite participation in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, a mass mobilization against state building in the postrevolutionary United States. Elites without patronage ties, and those whose clienteles overlapped with those of federal officers, were more likely to mobilize against the state."

The purpose of this study of a random sample of male seniors in an Ivy League college was to ascertain wheter recent social changes and consequent malintegration with regard to sex roles have created stressful repercussions for men as well as for women. It was hypothesized that male seniors would suffer from socially structured scarcity of resources for living up to the norm of masculine intellectual superiority in their relationships with female friends who are also college students of nearly the same age. This hypothesis was confirmed for one-third of the sample. An explanation for the adjustment of the majority is supported by data from the study. The male attitudes toward their future marital roles are replete with inconsistencies. Underlying the inconsistencies are some basic conflicts of interests and of norms. Much of the ideology wich buttressed the traditional sex role differentiations in marriage has been undermined, but the belief that the husband must be the superior achiever in the occupational world and the wife the caretaker of young children, is still deeply rooted."

For the past four decades the medical profession has been accessible almost exclusively to the children of the elite classes. Despite this class closure, the expansion of the medical profession is linked with a substantial increase in status mobility from families that own commercial shops. This movement from the bourgeoisie into the government bureaucracy indicates the relevance of Weber's theory of patrimonial authority for comparative analysis."

His more important contributions are: (I) the demonstration that evolutionary doctrine does not sanction political quietism and laissez faire; (2) a clarification of the concept of liberty through a discriminating classification of the various types of liberty; (3) a defense of democracy, though admitting its many efects in its present undeveloped form; (4) the proof that a democratic system must embrace social and economic, as well as political, democracy; (5) the thesis that militarism and imperialism are fundamentally opposed to democracy, and that the problems of modern society resolve themselves into an application of our social science and our accumulated intelligence to the task of reconstructing nor only internal social, economic, and political conditions, but also international relations. His social philosophy is the ost effective English substantiation of Lester F. Ward's notion of social telesis."

It may signal aggresive or dominating intent, as in a staredown, or it may convey an impression of close bonding, intimacy, or a request for aid, depending on how actors define the situation. Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers."

In the days of serfdom the landlord and government dealt with the often remote commune as a unit. With the coming of emancipation a form of local government was instituted known as the Zemstvo, the peasants forming a sort of electoral college whose deputies selected district representatives from candidates proffered by the provincial governonr. The October Revolution found the villages taking over the estates of the landlords, the land theoretically belonging to the state and being divided impartially by a local committee. The pyramidal structure of the Soviet state rests upon the peasant and worker but not equally. Suffrage is extended to every worker over eighteen with few exceptions. Elections for representatives are held once a year; the slate is prepared by the party nucleus. Elections are very informal. The council elects delegates to the county soviet, and that body in turn to the state soviet, and so on to Moscow. The local group divides itself into commissions to deal with the village affairs. Informality holds in matters of the court, justice in local affairs moves considerately, and there are no subtleties of law. The center of the cultural and social activities of the village is the ""People's House,"" and practically every village boasts its public playground and football field. These social leavens have been set to work in the remotest villages. All village activities are based on local autonomy, but party members from the city volunteer to live in the villages and are expected to participate in all village affairs."

These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual‐level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data‐gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations."

Why, then, did Durkheim write his Latin thesis on Montesquieu, insisting that the latter had ""laid down the principles of the new science""? The answer is twofold: first because Montesquieu himself was extremely ambivalent about the French Enlightenment's confident legacy of Cartesian reationalism and second because this made Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws the ""perfect forge"" within which Durkheim could explore his own ambivalence about the relative merits of French rationalism and German empiricism, and thus shape the tool-the comparative method-he applied in The Division of Labor in Society."

Three central contingencies of an initial metamorphosis, from sober dispositions to doing laughter, are specified. The would-be laugher must collaboratively construct the presumption that another person shares his or her perspective on the mirror's reflections, develop mutually untenable definitions of a person and that person's reflections, and display a corporeal appreciation of the sensed juxtaposition. Each of these dimensions is altered when participants undergo a second metamorphosis, a shift to being done by the spirit raised. A final section analyzes the trascendent powers of family relations as they play on glaces bizarres."

He opposed the program to level art to the comprehension of the proletarian, holding that the new freedom would raise the standards and multiply the interests of the workers. His was a militant attack on the concept of a proletarian culture. A sharp opposition to him has developed, Lunacharsky insisting that at least in a transition stage a distinctive class art was necessary. Other bolshevik critics have opposed his position. While events in the development of the art of Russia have confirmed the position of his opponents, Trotsky's contribution to sociological aesthetics remains highly significant."
