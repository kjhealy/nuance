This article outlines and explains this paradigm split and the resulting shifts of critical theories from ""reproduction"" to ""resistance"" to ""post-Marxist"" versions, then explains how these approaches differ from the mainstream and what their internal dynamic is. The article argues that the ""immanentism""-the practice of asserting a necessary movement of history that confers subordinate groups with objective interest in radical change-of critical approaches is the source of theoretical difference and that the trajectory of critical theories reflects shifting conceptions of how this change will occur."

The study first decomposes Theil's T to show that between-country inequality is the most significant component of overall world income inequality, which facilitates fruther research, as between-country longitudinal data are more easily available than national income distribution data. Next, the study uses a larger set of nations and finds a signigicant increase in world income inequality as measured by both Gini and Theil coefficients, particularly during the 1980s. The findings are robust even after controlling for differential rates of population growth or using alternative sources of data. By indentifying these trends, the article is able to explain past discrepancies and recent shifts in the relevant empirical and theoretical literature."

Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non‰€êNLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized. The findings have implications for future research on labor unions and represent an important step toward an empirical understanding of processes of institutionalization within social movements generally."

Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be ‰€œone who aspires.‰€ù"

Neither marital attachment nor job stability, factors frequently associated with male desistance from crime, were strongly related to female or male desistance. A symbolic‰€êinteractionist perspective on desistance is developed as a counterpoint to Sampson and Laub‰€™s theory of informal social control, and life history narratives are used to illustrate the perspective. This cognitive theory is generally compatible with a control approach but (a) adds specificity regarding underlying change mechanisms, (b) explains some negative cases, and (c) fits well with life course challenges facing contemporary serious female (and more provisionally male) offenders."

Quantitative cross‰€ênational data on a more recent wave of democratizations, from 1989 to 1996, confirm these findings. Models using direct maximum‰€êlikelihood estimation find that the ratio of adults with higher education has a significant positive effect on change in democracy levels, as measured by two longitudinal scales (Polity IV and Polyarchy).

The substantive focus concerns the relation between organization age and the hazard of mortality. The literature contains claims that the hazard (a) falls with age (a ‰€œliability of newness‰€ù), (b) rises initially and then falls with age (a ‰€œliability of adolescence‰€ù), (c) rises with age (‰€œliabilities of senescence and obsolescense‰€ù). The formalizations reported cast the relevant theoretical arguments as propositions involving five concepts: endowment, imprinting, inertia, capability, and position. It shows that each of the theoretical stories can be derived as implications of particular assumptions within two broad formalizations. This analysis clarifies the mechanizms at work in each theoretical account and provides guidance for expirical research designed to discriminate among the competing theories."

Informal reputation-based arrangements may substitute for government enforcement, but they require close-knit networks that enable monitoring. Economic development also requires access to capital, information, and other resources, which is enabled by wide-reaching and diverse networks and not by closure. How is entrepreneurship possible given these conflicting demands? In this article, the authors examine how partnership networks and reputation channel the mobilization of capital for new enterprises, using quantitative information on 4,172 corporate partnerships during the industrialization of late imperial Russia (1869‰ÛÒ1913). They find that reputation is locally effective in small and homogeneous network components. By contrast, founders in the largest components that form the network core raise more capital from investors but benefit less from reputation and more from brokerage opportunities and ties that reach diverse communities."

Challengers seek to appropriate and subvert the dominant discourses that legitimate power, creating discursive repertoires.

Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks‰€™ transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept. The texts also make clear that race is not a one‰€êtime construct or a relic of centuries past. Instead, it is continually remade‰€”and is being reworked today‰€”suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification."

This is especially true for initial courtship encounters when pairs report a sense of interpersonal chemistry. The authors explore the process of romantic bonding by applying interaction ritual theory, extended and integrated with methods from computational linguistics, to the study of courtship encounters and, specifically, heterosexual speed dating. The authors find that the assortment of interpersonal moves associated with a sense of connection characterizes a conventionalized form of initial courtship activity. The game is successfully played when females are the point of focus and engaged in the conversation and males demonstrate alignment with and understanding of the female. In short, initial heterosexual courtship encounters are associated with a sense of bonding when they reflect a reciprocal asymmetrical performance in which differentiated roles are mutually coordinated."

It is argued that social exchange produces positive or negative global feelings, which are internally rewarding or punishing. The theory indicates that social units (relations, groups, networks) are perceived as a source of these feelings, contingent on the degree of jointness in the exchange task. The jointness of the task is greatest if (1) actors find it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on or contributions to solving the exchange task (nonseparability) and (2) actors perceive a shared responsibility for success or failure at the exchange task. The theory explicates the effects of different exchange structures on these conditions and, in turn, on cohesion and solidarity. Implications are developed for network‰€êto‰€êgroup transformations."

In 1913, defending the ""principal ideas"" of that work, Durkheim supported his conception of the ""duality of human nature"" (simultaneously social and individual) by emphasizing the ""dynamogenic quality of religion,"" its ability to inspire human aciton a well as to curb it. These arguments do not represent a straighforward development of Durkheim's earlier work but must be undestood within the borader intellectual context within which he worked. Of particular importance were the growing differences among British social anthropologists, notably William Robertson Smith and James Frazer, concerning the mythic or utilitarian nature of primitive religion. On the evidence of this context, it is argued that one of the most critical shifts in the development of Durkheim's sociology of religion took place only after 1900. The process by which Durkheim developed his arguments in support of the former position may be understood in the light of recent work associated with the ""strong programme"" in the sociology of science. Major contemporary works used by Durkheim can be viewed as exemplars and the basis for analogies between substantively different areas of work rather than as the product of the application of a generalizable sociological method."

It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965‰ÛÒ99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions."

Sharing an understanding does not necessarily imply having the same opinions but rather agreeing on the structures of relevance and opposition that make symbols and actions meaningful. Because meaning is contextual, different people might interpret the same reality in different ways. Yet standard quantitative sociological methods are not designed to take such heterogeneity into account. In this article, I introduce a new method‰€”relational class analysis‰€”that uses attitudinal data to identify groups of individuals that share distinctive ways of understanding the same domain of social activity. To demonstrate its utility I use it to reexamine the cultural omnivore thesis. I find that Americans' understandings of the social symbolism of musical taste are shaped by three competing logics of cultural distinction, in a manner that complicates contemporary sociological accounts of artistic taste."

Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of ‰€œcontentious‰€ù political action. Instead, to establish tribes‰€™ status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians."

Structural explanation is described as an alternative. Umberto Eco's idea of a semantic encyclopedia is used as the basis of an illustration which is set forth in contrast to a formalist (Blau) and an interpretativist (Bittner/Garfinkel) theory of social structures.

Analyses of a later wave of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism reveal a complex interplay of the GABRA2 gene with social structural factors to produce cases meeting DSM/ICD diagnoses. Only modest evidence suggests that genetic influence works through social conditions and experiences. Further, women are largely unaffected in their risk for alcohol dependence by allele status at this candidate gene; family support attenuates genetic influence; and childhood deprivation exacerbates genetic predispositions. These findings highlight the essential intradisciplinary tension in the role of proximal and distal influences in social processes and point to the promise of focusing directly on dynamic, networked sequences that produce different pathways to health and illness."

Because there are differences in the way power is constituted at the transnational and national levels, theories of national political opportunity structures cannot be directly mapped onto the transnational level. The author describes three primary dimensions of political opportunity structure at the transnational level that explain how power is established: (1) the constitution of transnational actors and interests, (2) the definition and recognition of transnational rights, and (3) adjudication at the transnational level. The case of NAFTA suggests that while the emergence of national social movements requires nation‰€êstates, global governance institutions can play a pivotal role in the development of transnational social movements."

By comparing earnings of four groups of workers‰€”U.S.‰€êborn whites, U.S.‰€êborn Asian‰€êAmericans, U.S.‰€êeducated Asian immigrants, and Asian immigrants who completed education prior to immigration, we examine earnings gaps between whites and Asian‰€êAmericans that are attributable to race, nativity, and place of education. Our results show that (1) there is no earnings difference across U.S.‰€êborn whites, U.S.‰€êborn Asian‰€êAmericans, and U.S.‰€êeducated Asian immigrants, and that (2) foreign‰€êeducated Asian immigrants earn approximately 16% less than the other three groups of workers.

Study 2 found that threatened men expressed greater support for, and desire to advance in, dominance hierarchies. Study 3 showed in a large-scale survey on a diverse sample that men who reported that social changes threatened the status of men also reported more homophopic and prodominance attitudes, support for war, and belief in male superiority. Finally, study 4 found that higher testosterone men showed stronger reactions to masculinity threats than those lower in testosterone. Together, these results support the masculine overcompensation thesis, show how it can shape political and cultural attitudes, and identify a hormonal factor influencing the effect."

Property tansformation in postsocialist Hungary involves the decentralized reorganization of assets and the centralized management of liabilities. Together they blur the boundaries of public and private, the boundaries of enterprises, and the boundedness of justificatory principles. Enterprise-level field research, data on the ownership structure of Hungary's 220 largest enterprises and banks, and an examination of the government's recent debt consolidation programs suggest the emergence of a distinctively East European capitalism that will differ as much from West European capitalism as do contemporary East Asian variants."

This essay explores his views about the depletion of social resources stressed in modern theory. It elaborates his ""antisociology"" and then traces the impact of this framework on three divergent currents of social theory. Nietzsche is read against the backdrop of modern theory in order to explore his continuing challenge to this tradition and his relevance to sociology."

Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market‰€”a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action problems. The author develops a different account by viewing institutions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing conflict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental certification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market‰€êbased approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the ‰€œpolitical construction of market institutions.‰€ù The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms."

First, Parsons's Structure of Social Action is scrutinized. It is shown that Parsons so construes Hobbes that the ""problem of order"" for social theory is answered by the concept of internalized normative motivation. As a consequence of this focus, Parsons derogates an analytically independent ""cognitive"" element in action and elegates cognitive matters either to the ""scientific"" or ""normative"" orientations. Second, the interrelated series of articles by Pope, Cohen, and Hazelrigg are shown to rest on framework assumptions similar to Parsons's own, while drawing nearly opposite conclusions, rendering Durkheim a ""positivist"" and Weber a ""utilitarian"" in Parsons's sense of these terms. Third, a ""redefined theory of action"" is proposed which acknowledges explicitly the analytically independent role of the cognitive element in action. Some course-of-action statements drawn from Durkheim and Weber and focusing on the cognitive structuring of the ""situation"" and of ""end"" are presented and shown to involve compatible reasoning.

A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‰€êfulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically."

But, for states to be successful in fostering development, they need a considerable degree of internal cohesiveness, which is generally supplied by the presence of a robust, Weberian bureaucratic corps. This article argues that, while internal cohesiveness is indeed critical, bureaucratic rule following can produce results in the opposite direction, depending on the interagency relations that obtain within the state. The effect of interagency relations is demonstrated through an examination of India and Korea. Both have worked to foster industrialization, and both are endowed with relatively healthy bureaucracies. However, the Indian state was paralyzed and fragmented, while its Korean counterpart did secure the requisite internal coherence. Not only did the culture of rule following fail to generate a cohesive state in India, but it, in fact, worked against such an outcome."

But ideas vary greatly as to how such effects may come about. Perhaps the most difficult problem for proponents of any such ""model of relevance"" is to show how social insight can serve the general good when it addresses conflict situations in which help to one set of interests necessarily entails damage to others. Several different models of relevance are considered, as manifested in the writings of both classical and contemporary writers, including Sumner, Merton, Marx, Mills, and Barrington Moore, Jr. None of the formulations is found altogether satisfactory in resolving the problems inherent in building such models."

Under this legislation, programs are encouraged to teach that nonmarital sex is likely to have harmful psychological effects. Life course concepts and identity theory suggest that sex may be consequential for the mental health of some adolescents. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this article investigates mental health consequences of adolescent sex. The analyses reveal important contingencies of the effect of first sex. Timing relative to age norms, romantic relationship factors, and gender interact to condition the effect of first sex on mental health. While some adolescents experience mental health decrements, the majority of those who had first sex did not. This finding highlights the importance of considering contingencies when investigating the effects of life events on mental health."

Self-employment declined in the United States almost steadily from the 19th century to the early 1970s. Since then, it has risen every year. Explaining this reversal in the historical fortunes of the petty bourgeoisie is the central task of this article. We reach four basic conclusions: first, the reversal in the decline of the self-employed is statistically significant and robust across a range of definitions of self-employment rates. Second, this reversal is not a simple countercyclical response to the increase in unemployment since the middle 1970s. Third, part of the resurgence of self-employment result from the expansion of various postindustrial services that tend to have higher levels of self-employment within them. Within postindustrial sectors, however, there has not generally been any increase in self-employment. Fourth, a significant part of the expansion of self-employment is explained by a increase in self-employment within most of the traditional sectors of the industrial economy."

Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs."

Infant mortality was chosen for its importance as a social indicator and its putative sensitivity to state action over a short time span.

A net effect of health spending is also found, even when controlling for the level of spending in the year after which the outcome is measured (to account for spurious effects or reverse causation). State spending affects infant mortality both through social mechanisms and through medical ones. This article also shows that the impact of state spending may vary by the institutional structure of the welfare state. Finally, this study tests for structural breaks in the relationship between health spending and infant mortality and finds none over this time period."

The author finds that a much wider range of institutions engage in affirmative action for African‰€êAmerican students than previous analysts reported, and that a growing number of institutions extend the benefits of affirmative action to Hispanic students. Colleges and universities are markedly less enthusiastic about engaging in affirmative action for socioeconomically disadvantaged students. To understand why postsecondary institutions prefer students from particular minority groups over otherwise comparable white students, the author introduces the concept of compensatory sponsorship (building on Turner‰€™s ideal‰€êtype of sponsored mobility). In a contest system perceived by many to disadvantage some competitors unfairly, college personnel engage in affirmative action both to right a perceived wrong and to preserve the legitimacy of the contest. The beneficiaries of compensatory sponsorship, however, are determined by historical and social forces that constrain how postsecondary institutions recruit, admit, and fund potential matriculants."

Predictions are then examined using qualitative comparative analysis for 16 northern cities that participated in the 1919 steel strike. Results show that interracial solidarity developed in cities that had strong local union organizations and nonrepressive governments, while black strikebreaking emerged in cities with higher proportions of recent black migrants and either repressive local governments or weak unions."

These mobilization paths arose from the patterned intersections of individual‰€êlevel biographies, networks, and situational contexts. The implications of these findings extend beyond studies of revolutionary activism to analyses of microlevel mobilization in general. Activists are heterogeneous and often follow multiple paths to the same participation outcome. Capturing these multiple paths is imperative for generating theoretically sound explanations of mobilization that are also empirically effective in distinguishing activists from nonactivists."

They argued that, in a period of economic stagnation such as occurred in the 1970s, there should be an acceleration of the process of proletarianization and a decline in the expansion of managerial and semiautonomous employee (or expert) locations in the class structure. These changes should occur both because of an intensification of proletarianization within economic sectors and because of decline in the shift of employment into the relatively less proletarianized sectors such as the state. On the basis of the data used in this study, none of these predictions is supported. Indeed, the evidence indicates a decisive acceleration of the growth of managerial class locations in the 1970s and a clear deproletarianization within and across economic sectors. These findings are interpreted as a result of two principal factors: the internationalization of American class relations during the 1970s and the effect of technological and organizational changes in production on clases in the United States."

It is analyzed as the outcome of intraorganizational conflics between elites of two parallel stuctures within denominations: religious authority and agencies. Using longitudinal data collected from 83 Protestant denominations, this article finds that, generally, religious authority has decreasing control over denominations' organizational resources. But internal secularization is neither complete nor irreversible. Drawing on organizational and social movement theory, this article connects variation in internal secularization primarily to variation in the extent to which both religious authority and agencies are centralized. Recently resurgent religious authority is discussed."

In contrast, the treadmill of production theory argues that the strong relationship between environmental harms and economic development will remain constant or possibly increase through time. To evaluate these competing propositions, interactions between economic development and time are used in cross-national panel analyses of three measures of carbon dioxide emissions. The results vary across the three outcomes as well as between developed and less developed countries, providing mixed support for both theoretical perspectives. The authors conclude by discussing how both theories could benefit from engaging contemporary research concerning changes within the transnational organization of production and the structure of international trade and how these global shifts influence environment/economic development relationships."

This simplistic view of the policy process runs the risk of masking how movements and other factors matter at various stages of the policy process. Each stage is characterized by different rules and different consequences; thus, movements and other factors ought to matter differently at each stage. The authors examine three stages of policy development with regard to state ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Results show that movements mattered more to legislative decisions in the earlier stages of the policy process, but that their effects were eclipsed in later stages by public opinion."

Its actual analysis, however, from this standpoint is difficult. Several distinct strands may be detected in what looks at first sight like an integral phenomenon. The social norm is always to be distinguished from the individual increment of expression, which is never discernible in itself, but only as measured against this norm. Moreover, ""speech"" consists of at least five levels of behavior, the expressive value of any one of which need not be confirmed by all the others. These levels are the voice as such, speech dynamics, the pronunciation, the vocabulary, and the style of connected utterance. Owing to the possibility of detecting conflict and other symptomatic reactions in speech, language behavior becomes a suggestive field for research in problems of personality."

It is found that literacy did not promote rural disturbances as such but that the forms and targets of peasant actions in the more literate areas difered from those in the less literate. The less literate districts were notable for mobilization against rumored but nonexistent invasions, whereas the most literate districts nurtured attacks on the central social institutions of the Old Regime."

Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a ‰€œmoving target,‰€ù with state and societal actors building on legal as well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced explanations of state policy that are both ‰€œpolitical‰€ù and ‰€œinstitutional‰€ù and that highlight the centrality of legal interpretation and judicial review to political sociology."

A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites‰€”a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority‰€”assume an oppositional posture.

This study finds that Brazilians understand the discriminatory basis of inequality and that an attitudinal dimension associated with racial democracy strongly increases the likelihood of that understanding. Negative stereotyping produces a smaller opposite effect, and ‰€œrace‰€ù is not a significant predictor. Finally, Brazilian and American racial attitudes differ considerably in explaining black disadvantage. These findings question perceptions of Brazilian racial attitudes and the efficacy of dominant theories for their analysis, suggesting a context‰€êdriven approach to theorizing and for antidiscrimination strategizing."

Using quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression, the author shows that social ties formed through common membership on corporate boards contribute more to similarity of political behavior than commonalities of economic interests, such as those associated with operating in the same industry or the same geographic region. Moreover, the politically cohesive effects of directorship ties remain robust even as one moves several links down the chain of indirect ties that connect top corporate officers to one another. The study thus provides empirical support for the thesis that social networks among corporate elites facilitate political cohesion within the business community."

The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult.

In fact, because identity politics occupies two major points of tension, it gives rise to several alternative ways of conceptualizing the ‰€œwe,‰€ù the collective self. Using ethnographic material gathered on American Jews‰€™ understandings of anti-Semitism and its relationship to contemporary politics, this article inductively discerns four alternative models of collective selfhood (embattled, relating, political, and redeemed) that correspond to four alternative narratives of identity politics (reified identity, humanistic dialogue, critical solidarity, and evangelism). These narratives help explain the deep emotions sparked by challenges to people‰€™s self-definitions. A comparison to studies of LGBT movements further reveals the utility of this conceptualization and elaborates a model not apparent in the first case."

Mare,American Journal of Sociology,89,1,1983-07-01T00:00:00Z,pp. 54-110,The University of Chicago Press,fla,,"This article proposes a solution to the long-standing methodological problem of incorporating discrete variables inoto causal models of social phenomena. Only a subset of the variety of ways in which discrete data arise in empirical social research can be satisfactorily modeled by conventional log-linear or logit approaches. Drawing on the insights of several literatures, this article exposits a general approach to causal models in which some or all variables are discretely measured and shows that path analytic methods are available which permit quantification of causal relationships among variables with the same flexibility and power of interpretation as is feasible in models that include only continous variables. It presents methods of identifying and estimating these models and shows how the direct and indirect effects of independent varibles can be calculated by extensions of usual path analysis methods for continuos variables An important distincion developed here is that discrete variables can play two roles: (1) as measures of inherently discrete phenomena and (2) as indicators of underlying continous variables. The value of this distinction is shown in two empirical examples examined previously by other authors. In examining the effects of social background and parental enouragement on college plans of high school seniors, the article shows that modeling a discrete measure of encouragement as an indicator of a latent continous variable rather than as an inherently discrete variable (as has been done in previous analyses) provides a clearer interpretation and a superior fit to the data. In examining the effects of state Fair-Employment-Practices Legislation on black-white wage differentials, this study shows that two distinct effects on the relative wage can be detected: the direct ameliorative effect of the law itself and the effects of the popular progressive sentiment for racial equality of which the law is an indicator. The methods and models presented here are not only natural generalizations of structural equation and path analysis methods for continuous varibles to include discrete variables but also provide a means of investigating a richer variety of substantive hypotheses than is feasible with methods for discrete data commonly used in the sociological literature to date."

The development of a systematic and general explanation of imprisonment trends has been impeded because of the theoretical and methodological limitations of prior quantitative studies. Most use data from a single country or jurisdiction and focus narrowly on the Rusche‰€êKirchheimer ‰€œlabor surplus‰€ù hypothesis, with little attention to alternative explanations. This study takes a cross‰€ênational perspective, using longitudinal data from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States to offer an institutional account of imprisonment rates. The labor surplus effect is treated as a special case of a more general process by which individuals are allocated among alternative life‰€êcourse paths. This allocation process is likely to be influenced by macrolevel institutional arrangements and contests for political power. Hypotheses are tested using pooled time‰€êseries cross‰€êsection regression techniques. Results support this broadened perspective: prison growth is driven not only by crime rates and unemployment rates, but also by welfare spending and the power of right parties."

The author provides an alternative interpretation: hybrids can maintain a distinctive boundary and can emerge from contestation, not coexistence. This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic‰€êcommercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics."

The analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime control politics and policies at the national level that reflected historical traditions found in Sun Belt states."

One dimension, power, entails conduct by which actors compel other actors to do what they do not wish to do. The other dimension, status, entails conduct that conveys voluntary compliance, deference, and acceptance. The article considers a number of findings that seem to argue against the power-status model but contends that the exceptions either are not sociologically pertinent or do not reflect relational conduct. On the basis of an analysis of social and cultural macromodels that appear in the work of Parsons, Weber, Douglas, and Hirschman, it is argued that the power and status dimensions may be generalized ""upward"" to macroconditions. Two applications of power-status analysis, one from the domain of stratification, the other from the domain of emotions, conclude the article."

Since new organizational forms jeopardize existing interests, institutional entrepreneurs recombine prevalent cultural materials to frame the form as necessary, valid, and appropriate. When rival entrepreneurs promote incompatible frames, the frame that enjoys greater political support from the state, professions, and other organizations becomes ascendant. Proponents of losing frames can exit, migrate, or convert to the ascendant frame.

They argue that socialism was made into a laboratory of economic knowledge during the socialist calculation debate of the 1920s and 1930s. An extensive debate during the Cold War is also documented and shows that a transnational network continued to be organized around attempts to connect the results obtained in the socialist laboratory with debates and struggles in Western economics. Finally, the drafting of transition blueprints in postcommunist Eastern Europe after 1989, with the participation of American economists, is shown to be a continuation of this transnational network."

Moreover, important racial disparities in migration patterns remain poorly understood. Drawing on data from the 2000 census, the author reappraises the link between migration and social mobility by taking relative deprivation into consideration. She examines the association between migration, disaggregated by region of origin and destination, and absolute and relative earnings and occupational prestige, separately by race. Findings lend new insight into the theoretical and stratification implications of growing racial disparities in migration patterns; while both blacks and whites who move north-south generally average lower absolute incomes than their stationary northern peers, they enjoy significantly higher relative social positions. Moreover, the relative ‰€œgains‰€ù to migration are substantially larger for blacks than for whites. The opposite patterns obtain for south-north migration."

For boys, (1) DRD2 risk is associated with a decreased likelihood of school continuation; (2) one configuration of social capital‰€”high parental socioeconomic status, high parental involvement in school, and a high‰€êquality school‰€”compensates for this negative relationship, consistent with environmental contingency; but (3) boys with DRD2 risk are less commonly observed in settings that are rich in social capital."

Each occupation maintains a sense of superior production (an ""occupational aesthetic"") that is not reducible to organizational demands. This perspective extends the production of culture approach that sees art as being like all work, suggesting, in contrast, that all work is like art. An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task."

This study engages this debate by using international data‰€”including math achievement scores from the Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study and country‰€êlevel data from the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Values Survey, and the International Social Survey Programme‰€”to demonstrate the importance of social factors and to estimate an upper bound for the impact of genetic factors. The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross‰€ênational variation in gender differences with country‰€êlevel predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women."

Applying the approach to 48 organizational forms in the health care sector, this study suggests that the development of novel forms is affected by the positioning of their identities with respect to existing form identities in the community, by the aggregate density and size of organizations matching those existing identities, and by the amount of attention directed at identity attributes by sector participants. Findings show that the process of form emergence is subject to population‰€êdependent effects akin to those noted previously for organizational entries within established populations. The aggregate density and size of organizations with similar identities increase the probability of form emergence to a point (cross‰€êform legitimation), but highly saturated regions of the identity space tend to be uninviting to new forms (cross‰€êform competition)."

These conclusions emerge from a reassessment of Glenn Firebaugh's broad critique of capital dependency research, which exposed an important error in earlier studies. The solution charts new theoreticall ground by factoring dependency effects into the differential productivity of foreign and domestic investment and the negative externalities from foreign capital penetration. The revised formulation is applied to cross-national analyses of economic growth, decapitalization, and income inequality. The findings consistently support capital dependency theory."

In links developments in the sociology of emotions to theories of status and provides a theoretical explanation of the predominance of positive over negative socioemotional behavior in task groups. The analysis indicates that the status herarchy asymmetrically limits the expression of negative socioemotional behaviors arising from disagreements but does not constrain positive socioemotional expressions arising from agreements. Performance expectations determine the causal attributions of disagreement and consequently the emotion felt and the likelihood that negative behavior will result. As a result, the overall level of negative, but not positive, behaviors is reduced, status struggles are contained, and group solidarity is encouraged. Also, low-status members often elicit negative emotions but must absorb rather than respond to them."

Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of ‰€œfiscal inquisition‰€ù weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th‰€êcentury movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy."
